# Good Link Policy

This document uses correct link patterns:

- Site-absolute link: [Feature Documentation](/docs/features/analytics)
- Site-absolute with anchor: [Architecture Flow](/docs/implementation-technical/architecture-system#database)
- External link: [GitHub](https://github.com/penguinmails)

All internal links use the `/docs/` prefix without `.md` extensions.
