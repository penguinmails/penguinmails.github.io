# Complex Relative Paths

This document contains complex relative paths that go up multiple levels:

- Bad link: [Campaign Journey](../../docs/operations-analytics/analytics-performance/user-journey-analytics-campaigns.md)
- Bad link: [Architecture](../../docs/implementation-technical/architecture-system/overview.md)

These unusual patterns should use simple site-absolute paths like `/docs/section/file`.
