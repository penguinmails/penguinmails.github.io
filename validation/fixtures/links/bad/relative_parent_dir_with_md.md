# Relative Parent Directory Links with .md Extension

This document contains relative links using `../` prefix with `.md` extension:

- Bad link: [Roadmap](../roadmap/README.md)
- Bad link: [Features Overview](../features/README.md)
- Bad link: [Operations Guide](../operations/framework.md)

These should use site-absolute paths without `.md` extension.
