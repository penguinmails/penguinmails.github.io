# Relative Same Directory Links with .md Extension

This document contains relative links using `./` prefix with `.md` extension:

- Bad link: [User Journey Testing](./user-journey-testing.md)
- Bad link: [Overview Document](./overview.md)
- Bad link: [Setup Guide](./setup-guide.md)

These should use site-absolute paths without `.md` extension.
