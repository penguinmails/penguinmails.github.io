# Relative Links with Anchors

This document contains relative links with anchor fragments:

- Bad link: [SOP Workflow](./task-clarity-essentials#sop-workflow)
- Bad link: [Communication Protocols](../operations/framework#communication-protocols)
- Bad link: [Payment Model](./quotation-guide#task-based-payment-model)

These should use site-absolute paths while preserving the anchor fragments.
