# Relative Same Directory Links

This document contains relative links using `./` prefix:

- Bad link: [Code Standards](./code-standards)
- Bad link: [API Reference](./api-reference)
- Bad link: [Testing Guide](./testing-requirements)

These should use site-absolute paths like `/docs/section/file` instead.
