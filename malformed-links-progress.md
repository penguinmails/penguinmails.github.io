## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### Link Validation Rules
1. **Check if target exists**: Before adding `/`, verify if it's a file or folder
2. **File extensions**: Links to files should include `.md` extension
3. **Folder references**: Links to folders should end with `/`
4. **Cross-validation**: Ensure navigation will work in Jekyll

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Test key navigation paths
- [ ] Verify no broken internal references
- [ ] Check for consistent link formatting
- [ ] Review links point to valid destinations
