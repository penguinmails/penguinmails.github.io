# User Stories Prioritization Framework

## Overview

This document provides a systematic framework for prioritizing user stories across all user types. The framework ensures that development efforts align with business objectives while addressing the needs of internal users, external stakeholders, and customer users appropriately.

**Purpose**: Provide clear, consistent criteria and processes for prioritizing user stories that maximize business value and customer success.

## Prioritization Principles

### **1. Business Value First**
- Prioritize stories that deliver measurable business value
- Focus on outcomes rather than features
- Consider long-term strategic impact
- Balance short-term wins with long-term foundation building

### **2. User Type Priority Hierarchy**
- **Real External Users (Customers)**: Highest priority - direct revenue impact
- **Internal Platform Users**: High priority - operational efficiency and platform health
- **External Stakeholders**: Medium priority - business development and relationship value

### **3. Risk and Dependencies**
- Consider technical and business dependencies
- Prioritize foundation stories that enable other features
- Address high-risk areas early
- Balance technical debt with new feature development

### **4. User Journey Alignment**
- Prioritize stories that support complete user journeys
- Address critical gaps in user experience
- Focus on journey completion and success metrics
- Consider onboarding and user adoption factors
