# User Stories Methodology

## Overview

This document establishes a systematic, simplified approach to creating user stories that replaces the previous overwhelming framework. The methodology focuses on clarity, efficiency, and alignment with the three-user-type classification system.

**Purpose**: Provide a clear, repeatable process for creating user stories that serve product development, design, and engineering teams efficiently.

---

## Core Principles

### **1. User Type First**

Every user story must clearly identify which user type it serves:

- **Internal Platform Users**: Administrative and operational workflows
- **External Stakeholders**: Public-facing credibility and assessment workflows  
- **Real External Users**: Customer business operation workflows

### **2. Business Value Focus**

Every story must articulate clear business value:

- What business outcome does this enable?
- How does this improve efficiency, revenue, or user satisfaction?
- What measurable impact will this have?

### **3. Progressive Disclosure**

Stories should be structured to reveal information progressively:

- **Minimum Viable**: What must work for basic functionality?
- **Enhanced**: What improves the experience?
- **Advanced**: What provides power user capabilities?

### **4. Implementation Clarity**

Stories must be clear enough for implementation:

- Specific functionality requirements
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Measurable success metrics
- Dependencies and constraints

## Story Creation Process

### **Step 1: User Type Identification**

1. **Who is this story for?** (Internal/External Stakeholder/Customer)
2. **What specific role within that user type?** (Be specific)
3. **What journey phase does this support?** (Onboarding/Daily/Advanced/Problem/Growth)

### **Step 2: Business Value Definition**

1. **What business problem does this solve?**
2. **How does this improve efficiency, revenue, or satisfaction?**
3. **What measurable impact will this have?**

### **Step 3: Functionality Specification**

1. **What is the specific functionality required?**
2. **What are the must-have vs nice-to-have features?**
3. **What are the performance and quality requirements?**

### **Step 4: Acceptance Criteria Development**

1. **How will we know this is working correctly?**
2. **What are the specific, testable requirements?**
3. **What edge cases and error scenarios need to be handled?**

### **Step 5: Dependencies and Constraints**

1. **What technical dependencies exist?**
2. **What business or compliance constraints apply?**
3. **What timeline or resource constraints must be considered?**

## Prioritization Framework

### **Priority Levels**

#### **CRITICAL**

- **Definition**: Essential for MVP or core business operations
- **User Types**: Primarily Real External Users (customers)
- **Timeline**: Must be delivered in current sprint/iteration
- **Examples**: Core email sending, basic authentication, fundamental admin functions

#### **HIGH**

- **Definition**: Important for good user experience or operational efficiency
- **User Types**: All user types, emphasis on customer and internal users
- **Timeline**: Should be delivered within 2-4 sprints
- **Examples**: Enhanced reporting, user management improvements, basic integrations

#### **MEDIUM**

- **Definition**: Valuable for power users or operational optimization
- **User Types**: Internal users and advanced customer users
- **Timeline**: Planned for future sprints based on capacity
- **Examples**: Advanced analytics, workflow automation, enhanced integrations

#### **LOW**

- **Definition**: Nice-to-have features or edge case handling
- **User Types**: Primarily power users and internal optimization
- **Timeline**: Backlog for future consideration
- **Examples**: Advanced customization, niche integrations, enhanced UI polish

### **Priority Decision Matrix**

| User Type | Business Impact | Implementation Effort | Default Priority |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Real External Users | High | Any | HIGH |
| Real External Users | Medium | Low | HIGH |
| Real External Users | Medium | Medium | MEDIUM |
