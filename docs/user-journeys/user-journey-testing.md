# User Journey Testing Framework

## Overview

This document provides scenario-based testing for freelancer onboarding documentation to validate navigation paths, progressive disclosure implementation, and user experience optimization.

## Testing Methodology

### Fresh Eyes Testing Approach

We test navigation paths with users unfamiliar with current structure to identify:

- Navigation clarity and intuitive flows

- Information accessibility and comprehension

- Cross-reference link effectiveness

- Progressive disclosure structure validation
