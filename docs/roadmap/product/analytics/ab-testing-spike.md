# A/B Testing & Experimentation Spike

## Overview

**Priority**: P3 (Post-MVP)
**Effort**: Medium (1-2 weeks)
**Timeline**: Q2 2026

**Description**:
Evaluate PostHog's limitations for advanced A/B testing (multi-variate, bandit algorithms) and determine need for dedicated tools or custom solutions.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Conduct spike to evaluate PostHog's advanced experimentation features
- Compare against dedicated tools (LaunchDarkly, Statsig, VWO)
- Assess build vs. buy for custom bandit algorithms
- Document cost analysis for scaling experiments
- Create recommendation report

**Dependencies**:

- Core analytics complete
- Marketing team requirements definition
