# Spike: Granular Role Granularity

## Overview

**Priority**: P3 (Research)
**Timeline**: Q1 2027
**Effort**: Small

**Description**:
Evaluate if the MVP role set (Super Admin, Admin, QA) needs to be expanded with more granular department/team associations.

## Objectives

- Assess feedback from early enterprise adopters regarding role limitations
- Determine if "Department" or "Team" entities are needed as distinct permission scopes
- Prototype "Team Association" model if demand exists
