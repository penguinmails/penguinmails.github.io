# Third-Party Integrations Research Spike

## Overview

**Priority**: P3
**Effort**: 2 weeks (research only)
**Timeline**: Q3-Q4 2026

**Description**:
Research spike to evaluate ROI and customer demand for third-party integrations (CRM sync, lead enrichment, advanced email validation).

**Research Questions**:

- Do customers need vendor-specific CRM integrations or is API + webhooks sufficient?
- Do customers need lead enrichment or is "name, email" sufficient?
- What is the actual bounce rate with basic validation? Is advanced validation worth the cost?
- What is the ROI of each integration vs. development and operational costs?

**Dependencies**:

- 6-12 months of production data
- Customer feedback and feature requests
