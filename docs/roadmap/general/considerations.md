# Roadmap Considerations

## Understanding Our Feature Development Approach

This document explains the key considerations and philosophy behind our roadmap development to help you understand what to expect and when.

## Our Development Philosophy

### Progressive Enhancement

We follow a **progressive enhancement** approach, building from solid foundations to advanced capabilities:

```markdown
Level 1: Core Infrastructure → Level 2: MVP Features → Level 3: Growth → Level 4: Enterprise → Level 5: Future
```

### What This Means for You

#### Level 1-2: Focus on Core Value

**Timeline**: Q1 2026 - Q2 2026
**Philosophy**: "Get the fundamentals right first"

- **Email Infrastructure**: Reliable, automated setup
- **Basic Analytics**: Directional insights
- **Manual Processes**: Human oversight

#### Level 3+: Advanced Capabilities

**Timeline**: Q2 2026 onwards
**Philosophy**: "Build sophisticated features on proven foundation"

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live performance tracking
- **Enterprise Features**: SSO, advanced security

## Timeline Reality Check

### Why These Timelines?

#### MVP Timeline (Q1 2026 - Q2 2026)

- **Small Team**: 3-5 engineers
- **Foundation First**: Infrastructure before advanced features
- **Market Validation**: Prove concept first

- **Market Expansion**: Invest after MVP success
- **Team Scaling**: Larger team for complexity

#### Enterprise Timeline (Q4 2026-2027)
