# Task Clarity Essentials

## Quick Start Guide for Freelancers

This guide provides everything you need to understand task requirements, delivery standards, and workflow expectations at PenguinMails. Use this as your single source of truth for task completion criteria.

## 📋 Definition of Done (DoD)

### General Task Completion

A task is **Done** when:

- ✅ All acceptance criteria are met
- ✅ Work is reviewed, tested, and approved by the lead  
- ✅ Jira status is updated with all links or screenshots
- ✅ No blockers or pending dependencies remain
- ✅ Work is verified on staging

### Development Tasks

For development work, **Done** means:

- ✅ Code is committed, reviewed, and merged into the right branch
- ✅ Follows linting and naming standards
- ✅ Tested manually or with unit tests
- ✅ Documentation or .env.sample updated if needed
- ✅ Successfully deployed to staging

### Bug Fixes

For bug fixes, **Done** means:

- ✅ The issue is replicated and the root cause found
- ✅ Fix verified in staging with before/after proof
- ✅ Related areas regression-tested

### Research Spikes

For research tasks, **Done** means:

- ✅ Research completed and documented (Google Doc link in Jira)
- ✅ Includes clear findings or recommendations
- ✅ Reviewed by Anthony or team lead before closing

## 📊 Story Points Guide

Story points measure relative effort including complexity, uncertainty, and dependencies—not just time.

### Effort Estimation Guidelines

| Story Points | Meaning | Typical Effort |
| :----- | :----- | :---- |
| 1 point | Very small task | Quick config, text change, or minor UI fix, simple investigation or quick validation |
| 2 points | Small task | One function, small component, or bug fix |
| 3 points | Medium task | New feature with some logic or API use, Research + short proof of concept |
| 5 points | Large task | Multi-step logic, backend + frontend integration, deep research spike with multiple dependencies |
| 8 points | Complex feature | Multiple systems involved, requires testing + review |
| 13 points | Very complex | Requires research or touches critical flows (may split) |

### Estimation Process

- Always provide effort estimates (in story points) and delivery timeframes before accepting any task
- Clients evaluate and approve/reject effort point estimates as part of the task assignment framework
- Use relative estimation, comparing new tasks to known examples

## 🔄 SOP Workflow

### Task Status Progression

1. **Backlog** – Idea or future task
2. **Selected for Development** – Approved for the current sprint
3. **In Progress** – Developer actively working on it
4. **Ready for Testing** – Implementation complete and pending validation
5. **Blocked** – Stuck due to dependencies or missing inputs
6. **Done** – Fully reviewed and accepted

### Delivery Enforcement

- **2x Time Rule**: If task delivery exceeds **twice the originally estimated calendar time**, client may unilaterally terminate task without payment
- **Early Communication**: Must respond in writing to any client inquiries about task status after original delivery time has passed
- **Obstacle Reporting**: Must inform clients in writing of any obstacles or problems faced during task execution

## 🛠️ Tools Overview

### Primary Platforms

| Tool | Purpose | Usage |
| :----- | :----- | :----- |
| **Jira** | Task creation, sprint planning, progress tracking | Update progress daily, link PRs to tasks |
| **Discord** | Team communication, quick discussions, daily updates | All work discussions, tag teammates when response needed |
| **GitHub** | Code collaboration and version control | Keep PRs small and well-documented |
| **Google Docs/Sheets** | Documentation, PRDs, research outputs | Share research findings and documentation |

### Communication Standards

- All work-related discussions happen in Discord using defined channels
- Avoid direct messages for project-related issues, keep discussions transparent
- Tag teammates directly when a response is required
- Maintain professionalism and clarity at all times
- **Sync meetings**: Once per sprint (Planning + Demo)
- **Async updates**: Daily in the sprint channel
