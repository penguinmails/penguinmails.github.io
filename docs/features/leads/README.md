# ðŸ‘¥ Leads & Lists

Lead management, contact lists, and segmentation (scoped by tenant).

## Purpose

Organize and manage leads/contacts with tenant-scoped lists and segmentation.

## MVP Status

**Current Status**: Comprehensive documentation exists, MVP simplified to core features
**MVP Completion**: Q1 2026 (3-5 weeks)
**Priority**: P0 (Critical for campaign targeting)

### MVP Gaps (2 Features)

1. **Contact Import/Export Implementation** (P0, 2-3 weeks) - CSV/Excel import with field mapping, validation, duplicate detection

2. **Basic Contact Segmentation** (P0, 1-2 weeks) - Static lists for campaign targeting (dynamic segmentation moved to Post-MVP)

**Rationale**: MVP simplified to essential features only. Complex features (dynamic segmentation, lead scoring, activity timeline, bulk operations) moved to Post-MVP to enable faster time-to-market with core functionality.
