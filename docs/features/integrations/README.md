# 🔌 Integrations

Third-party system connections including CRM, webhooks, and external platforms.

**[📖 Read Full Integrations Overview](/docs/features/integrations/overview)** - Comprehensive guide to PenguinMails integration capabilities including API-first strategy, Vault secrets management, and implementation roadmap.

## MVP Status: API-First Approach

**Strategy**: Build general-purpose REST API + webhooks first (MVP), add vendor-specific integrations later (Post-MVP)

**Current State**: Foundation features documented, implementation in progress

**MVP Focus (Q1 2026)**:

- ✅ API Key Management System with Vault storage

- ✅ Core REST API endpoints (contacts, campaigns, emails, analytics)

- ✅ Webhook system for real-time event notifications

- ✅ API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

**Post-MVP (Q1-Q2 2026)**:

- Salesforce/HubSpot CRM integrations (Q1 2026)

- Zapier integration for 5,000+ apps (Q2 2026)

- ESP integration UI (Q3 2026)

**Rationale**: API-first approach enables customers to build custom integrations immediately while we develop pre-built vendor integrations on top of stable API foundation.

## Missing Features & Roadmap

### MVP Gaps (Q1 2026)

## Critical (P0) - Blocks programmatic integrations

1. **API Key Management UI** (5-7 days) - Self-service API key creation, viewing, regeneration, revocation

2. **Core REST API Implementation** (2-3 weeks) - Contacts, campaigns, emails, analytics endpoints

3. **API Documentation** (1 week) - OpenAPI/Swagger with interactive explorer and code examples

## High Priority (P1) - Enables real-time integrations

1. **Webhook System Backend** (1-2 weeks) - Event delivery engine with retry logic and signature verification

2. **Webhook Configuration UI** (1-2 weeks) - Self-service webhook setup with event selection and testing

**Total MVP Effort**: 6-9 weeks

### Post-MVP Roadmap

### Q1 2026: Advanced CRM Integrat

- Salesforce integration with OAuth and bi-directional sync (20-30 days)

- HubSpot integration with field mapping and workflow triggers (20-30 days)

### Q2 2026: No-Code Integrations

- Zapier integration for 5,000+ apps (2-3 weeks)

- Pre-built Zaps for common workflows

### Q3 2026: Enhanced Features

- ESP Integration UI for Postmark/Mailgun configuration (10-14 days)

- Custom Webhook Builder with advanced filtering (3-4 weeks)

- Additional CRM integrations (Pipedrive, Zoho, Close.io)

## Q4 2026+: Ecosystem Expansion

- Integration Marketplace for third-party developers (8-12 weeks)

- Real-Time Sync with sub-1-minute latency (6-8 weeks)

**Detailed Roadmap**: [Integrations Roadmap](/docs/features/integrations/roadmap)

## Vault Integration & Secrets Management

**Status**: ✅ Fully Documented - Architecture and implementation workflows defined

PenguinMails uses HashiCorp Vault for centralized secrets management, providing enhanced security, automated rotation, and disaster recovery capabilities.

**Key Features**:

- **VPS SSH Key Management**: Admin and tenant SSH keys stored in Vault with 90-day rotation

- **SMTP Credentials Storage**: MailU admin credentials encrypted and stored in Vault with 180-day rotation

- **Tenant API Key System**: API keys hashed with bcrypt and stored in Vault with on-demand rotation

- **Disaster Recovery**: Automated daily backups enable rapid recovery from VPS compromise or Vault failure

**Documentation**:
