# 🔧 Platform Administration (Internal)

**Target Users**: PenguinMails internal staff (super_admin, admin, support, qa)  
**Customer-Facing**: No - These are internal operational tools

## Overview

The PenguinMails admin panel provides operational tools for internal staff to manage the platform, monitor system health, support customers, and make data-driven executive decisions.

**Key Insight**: These features progressively expose more information for executive decision-making. Currently, PenguinMails executives use third-party tools (spreadsheets, external dashboards) for comprehensive reporting. Future enhancements will bring this data into the admin panel to answer questions like "how much money did we make last year?"
