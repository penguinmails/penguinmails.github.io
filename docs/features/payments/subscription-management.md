---

### Upgrading Your Plan

**Scale up as your business grows** - prorated billing ensures you only pay for what you use.

#### How to Upgrade

1. Go to **Settings** → **Billing** → **Change Plan**

2. Select higher-tier plan

3. Review **prorated cost** for current billing period

4. Confirm upgrade

5. Immediate access to new features

#### Proration Calculation

**Example:** Upgrade from Starter ($49/mo) to Professional ($149/mo) on day 15 of 30-day month:

```text
Days remaining in period: 15 days
Professional daily rate: $149 / 30 = $4.97/day
Starter credit: $49 / 30 = $1.63/day × 15 = $24.50
Upgrade cost: ($4.97 - $1.63) × 15 days = $50.10

Total charged today: $50.10
Next billing (full month): $149.00


```

**Benefits of Upgrading:**

- ✅ Immediate access to higher limits

- ✅ Pro-rated billing (fair pricing)

- ✅ Unlock advanced features instantly

- ✅ No downtime or service interruption

---

### Downgrading Your Plan

**Reduce costs if your needs change** - changes take effect at end of current billing period.

#### How to Downgrade

1. Go to **Settings** → **Billing** → **Change Plan**

2. Select lower-tier plan

3. Review **impact on usage limits**

4. Acknowledge data/feature limitations

5. Confirm downgrade

6. Changes effective **next billing cycle**

#### Important Downgrade Considerations

**What Happens When You Downgrade:**

- ⚠️ **Usage Limits Reduced** - Next billing cycle

- ⚠️ **Feature Access Lost** - Advanced features disabled

- ⚠️ **Data Retained** - No data loss, but access restricted

- ⚠️ **Exceeded Limits** - Must remove excess before downgrade

**Pre-Downgrade Checklist:**

- [ ] Check current usage vs new plan limits

- [ ] Remove excess team members if needed

- [ ] Archive or delete excess workspaces

- [ ] Disable features not in lower plan

- [ ] Backup data if concerned

**Example:** Downgrade from Professional (5 users, 10 workspaces) to Starter (2 users, 3 workspaces):

**Required Actions:**

1. Remove 3 team members (keep 2)

2. Delete or archive 7 workspaces (keep 3)

3. Downgrade takes effect next billing date
