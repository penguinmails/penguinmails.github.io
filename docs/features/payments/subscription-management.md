- Monthly cost

- Billing cycle (monthly/annual)

### Upgrading Your Plan

**Scale up as your business grows** - prorated billing ensures you only pay for what you use.

#### How to Upgrade

1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Billing** â†’ **Change Plan**

2. Select higher-tier plan

3. Review **prorated cost** for current billing period

4. Confirm upgrade

5. Immediate access to new features

#### Proration Calculation

**Example:** Upgrade from Starter ($49/mo) to Professional ($149/mo) on day 15 of 30-day month:

```text
Days remaining in period: 15 days
Professional daily rate: $149 / 30 = $4.97/day
Starter credit: $49 / 30 = $1.63/day Ã— 15 = $24.50
Upgrade cost: ($4.97 - $1.63) Ã— 15 days = $50.10

Total charged today: $50.10
Next billing (full month): $149.00

```

**Benefits of Upgrading:**

- âœ… Immediate access to higher limits

- âœ… Pro-rated billing (fair pricing)

- âœ… Unlock advanced features instantly

- âœ… No downtime or service interruption

---

### Downgrading Your Plan

**Reduce costs if your needs change** - changes take effect at end of current billing period.

#### How to Downgrade

1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Billing** â†’ **Change Plan**

2. Select lower-tier plan

3. Review **impact on usage limits**

4. Acknowledge data/feature limitations

5. Confirm downgrade

6. Changes effective **next billing cycle**

#### Important Downgrade Considerations

**What Happens When You Downgrade:**

- âš ï¸ **Usage Limits Reduced** - Next billing cycle

- âš ï¸ **Feature Access Lost** - Advanced features disabled

- âš ï¸ **Data Retained** - No data loss, but access restricted

- âš ï¸ **Exceeded Limits** - Must remove excess before downgrade

**Pre-Downgrade Checklist:**

- [ ] Check current usage vs new plan limits

- [ ] Remove excess team members if needed

- [ ] Archive or delete excess workspaces

- [ ] Disable features not in lower plan

- [ ] Backup data if concerned

**Example:** Downgrade from Professional (5 users, 10 workspaces) to Starter (2 users, 3 workspaces):

**Required Actions:**

1. Remove 3 team members (keep 2)

2. Delete or archive 7 workspaces (keep 3)

3. Downgrade takes effect next billing date
