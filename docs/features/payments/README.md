## Integration Philosophy

### Stripe Checkout (Hosted)

We use Stripe Checkout for all payment flows to ensure:

- **PCI Compliance**: No card data touches our servers.
- **Conversion**: Mobile-optimized, trusted UI.
- **Maintenance**: Zero custom form code.

### Dashboard-First

Users manage their own billing via Stripe Customer Portal:

- Update cards
- Download invoices
- Cancel subscriptions

### Webhooks as Truth

Database state is strictly driven by Stripe webhooks (`checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`), ensuring perfect sync with actual payment status.
