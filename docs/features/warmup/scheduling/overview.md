# Warmup Scheduling

**Quick Access**: Automatically warm up new email accounts and domains with intelligent scheduling, gradual volume increases, and engagement simulation to build sender reputation.

- **Domain & IP Warmup**: Separate strategies for domains and dedicated IPs

- **Engagement Simulation**: Automated opens, clicks, and replies

- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time warmup status and metrics

- **Custom Schedules**: Tailor warmup plans to your needs

- **Multi-Account Warmup**: Warm up multiple accounts simultaneously

- **Safety Limits**: Automatic throttling to prevent reputation damage
