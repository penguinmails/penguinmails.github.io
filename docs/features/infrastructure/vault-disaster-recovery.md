# Vault Disaster Recovery (Deprecated)

## Status

This page remains only to keep historical URLs functioning. All current disaster recovery content now lives in the modular documentation hub.

- [Automated Backup Strategy](/docs/features/infrastructure/vault-disaster-recovery/automated-backup-strategy)
- [VPS Migration Workflow](/docs/features/infrastructure/vault-disaster-recovery/vps-migration-workflow)
- [Vault Restoration from Backup](/docs/features/infrastructure/vault-disaster-recovery/vault-restoration-from-backup)
- [High Availability Setup](/docs/features/infrastructure/vault-disaster-recovery/high-availability-setup)
- [Monitoring and Alerting](/docs/features/infrastructure/vault-disaster-recovery/monitoring-and-alerting)
- [Emergency Procedures for Vault Compromise](/docs/features/infrastructure/vault-disaster-recovery/emergency-procedures-for-vault-compromise)
- [Implementation Checklist](/docs/features/infrastructure/vault-disaster-recovery/implementation-checklist)
- [Related Documentation](/docs/features/infrastructure/vault-disaster-recovery/related-documentation)

## Next Steps

- Update any bookmarks or inbound links to point at the new hub.
- Remove this deprecated shim once external consumers have migrated.
