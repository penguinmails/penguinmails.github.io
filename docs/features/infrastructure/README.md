# Infrastructure & Provisioning

Automated VPS management, IP allocation, SMTP servers, and infrastructure provisioning for reliable email delivery.

## MVP Status: Partially Complete

**Current State:** Core infrastructure provisioning is functional with automated VPS setup, SMTP configuration, and DNS management. However, critical operational features like backup/recovery, scaling UI, and cost tracking are missing.

**MVP Completion:** 7 additional features required (10-14 weeks development)

**Priority Focus:**

- **P0 (Critical):** Infrastructure Backup & Recovery System
- **P1 (High):** Scaling UI, IP Reputation Controls, Cost Tracking
- **P2 (Medium):** Health Alerts, DNS Troubleshooting, Usage History

## Features in This Category

### ✅ Available Now

- **[Email Infrastructure Setup](./email-infrastructure-setup.md)** - VPS provisioning, SMTP setup, DNS automation
- **[Free Mailbox Creation](./free-mailbox-creation/overview.md)** - Automated VPS setup and configuration
- **[Multi-Tenant Architecture](./multi-tenant-architecture.md)** - Database isolation and tenant management
- **[Hostwind Management](./hostwind-management.md)** - VPS provisioning and IP monitoring

**Current Capabilities:**

- Automated VPS provisioning via Hostwind API
- MailU SMTP server installation and configuration
- DNS record management (SPF, DKIM, DMARC, MX, A records)

### 🚧 MVP Gaps (Q1 2026)

**Critical Missing Features:**

- **Backup & Recovery System** - Automated backups, point-in-time recovery, disaster recovery procedures
- **Infrastructure Scaling UI** - Resource usage dashboard, upgrade recommendations, one-click scaling
- **IP Reputation Management** - User controls for blacklist removal, warmup adjustments, IP switching
- **Cost Tracking & Billing** - Per-workspace cost allocation, cost projections, budget alerts
- **Health Alerts & Notifications** - Multi-channel alerting, escalation policies, incident timeline
- **DNS Propagation Checker** - Real-time propagation status, troubleshooting wizard, provider-specific guidance
- **Resource Usage History** - 90-day usage trends, capacity planning, anomaly detection

**Why These Matter:**

- **Backup/Recovery:** Prevents data loss, required for compliance, blocks enterprise adoption
- **Scaling UI:** Prevents bottlenecks, enables growth, competitive standard feature
- **IP Reputation:** Critical for deliverability, reduces support burden, user self-service
- **Cost Tracking:** Required for agencies, enables cost optimization, transparent pricing

**Detailed Gaps:** See [Infrastructure Roadmap](./roadmap.md) for complete analysis

### 🔜 Post-MVP Enhancements (Q2 2026+)

**Q2 2026:**

- Multi-Region Infrastructure Deployment (US, EU, Asia)
- Auto-Scaling Based on Load (vertical and horizontal)

**Q3-Q4 2026:**

- Advanced Monitoring & Observability (distributed tracing, log aggregation)
- Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity (automated failover, geo-redundant backups)

**Q1 2027+:**

- Alternative VPS Providers (AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, Linode)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Export (Terraform, Pulumi)
- Advanced DNS Management (GeoDNS, DNSSEC, failover)

**Detailed Timeline:** See [Infrastructure Roadmap](./roadmap.md)

## Vault Integration Dependency

**CRITICAL:** Infrastructure provisioning depends on [Vault integration](/docs/features/integrations/overview.md#vault-integration) for secure secrets management.

**Vault-Stored Secrets:**

- **VPS SSH Keys:** Admin and tenant SSH keys for server access
- **SMTP Credentials:** MailU admin credentials for email server management
- **API Keys:** Tenant API keys for programmatic infrastructure management

**Security Benefits:**

- No secrets stored in environment variables or VPS filesystems
- VPS compromise mitigation (abandon VPS without losing secrets)
- Centralized secret rotation and access control
- Disaster recovery through Vault backup

**Related Features:**

- [VPS SSH Key Management](/docs/features/integrations/vault-ssh-keys.md) - Secure SSH access
- [SMTP Credentials Storage](/docs/features/integrations/vault-smtp-credentials.md) - Email server credentials
- [API Key System](/docs/features/integrations/vault-api-keys.md) - Programmatic access
