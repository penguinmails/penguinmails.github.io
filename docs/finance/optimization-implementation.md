## Investment Decision Framework

### Systematic Investment Evaluation Process

**Investment Scoring Criteria**:
- **Financial Return Potential (40%)**: Projected ROI, payback period, revenue impact
- **Strategic Alignment (25%)**: Alignment with business objectives and priorities
- **Risk Assessment (20%)**: Implementation risk, market risk, operational risk
- **Resource Requirements (15%)**: Capital needs, human resources, timeline feasibility

**Decision Timeline (30-45 days)**:
1. **Initial Assessment** (Days 1-7): Preliminary ROI analysis and viability screening
2. **Detailed Evaluation** (Days 8-21): Comprehensive financial and risk analysis
3. **Stakeholder Review** (Days 22-35): Cross-functional review and approval process
4. **Final Decision** (Days 36-45): Executive approval and investment authorization

**Investment Approval Thresholds**:
- <$50K: Department head approval with finance review
- $50K-$250K: Finance director approval with executive notification
- $250K-$1M: CFO approval with board notification
- >$1M: Board approval required

- Set monitoring cadence and reporting protocols

**Phase 2: Implementation ROI Monitoring**:
- Track actual vs. projected costs and timelines
- Monitor early ROI indicators and performance signals
- Adjust implementation based on ROI feedback
- Document lessons learned and optimization opportunities

**Phase 3: Post-Implementation ROI Analysis**:
- Calculate realized ROI against original projections
- Assess optimization impact on overall portfolio performance
- Identify best practices for future investment decisions
- Report ROI achievements and improvement opportunities

### ROI Confidence Intervals

**Confidence Level Framework**:
- **High Confidence (±10%)**: Mature investments with proven track records
- **Medium Confidence (±20%)**: Growth investments with market validation
- **Low Confidence (±35%)**: Innovation investments with uncertain outcomes

**Confidence Adjustment Process**:
1. Assign confidence level based on investment type and risk profile
2. Apply confidence interval to ROI projections and targets
3. Use directional ROI trends for decision-making rather than precise numbers
4. Update confidence levels based on actual performance data
