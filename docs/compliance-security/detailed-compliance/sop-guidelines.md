## 1. **Customer Excellence Framework**

This framework defines our standard processes for quality assurance, security compliance, service delivery, and customer success at PenguinMails.

It ensures all operational procedures follow consistent standards to improve customer satisfaction, service reliability, and delivery excellence.

## 2. **Tools & Platform**

* **Jira** – Task creation, sprint planning, progress tracking
* **Discord** – Team communication, quick discussions, and daily updates
* **Google Docs/Sheets** – Documentation, PRDs, and research outputs
* **GitHub** – Code collaboration and version control

## 3. **Communication Rules**

* All work-related discussions happen in Discord using defined channels.
* Avoid direct messages for project-related issues, keep discussions transparent.
* Tag teammates directly when a response is required.
* Maintain professionalism and clarity at all times.
* **Sync meetings**: Once per sprint (Planning + Demo)
* **Async updates**: Daily in the sprint channel.

## 4. **Task Management**

All tasks must include a clear title, description, acceptance criteria, labels, and assignee.

### Status Workflow

* **Backlog** – Idea or future task.
* **Selected for Development** – Approved for the current sprint.
* **In Progress** – Developer actively working on it.
* **Ready for Testing** – Implementation complete and pending validation.
* **Blocked** – Stuck due to dependencies or missing inputs.
* **Done** – Fully reviewed and accepted.

## 5. **Sprint Workflow**

Each sprint runs for 1–2 weeks, depending on scope.

### Phases

* **Planning**: Define sprint goals and prioritize tasks.
* **Execution**: Developers update Jira daily and communicate blockers.
* **Demo**: Product Owner and stakeholders review completed tasks.
* **Retrospective**: Discuss what went well and how to improve in the next sprint.

### Completion Rule

A task is considered done only if it meets acceptance criteria and has been verified by the Product Owner.

## 6. **Developers Responsibilities**

* Update progress daily in Jira.
* Report blockers early through Discord or directly in Jira.
* Keep PRs small and link them to relevant Jira tasks.
* Write short documentation for implemented features.

## 7. **Product Owner Responsibilities**

* Ensure backlog is groomed and prioritized before each sprint.
* Follow up on blockers and task progress.
* Maintain alignment between product goals and technical execution.
* Review, test, and validate completed work.

## 8. **Code & Infrastructure**

* All environments (staging, production) must have clear documentation.
* Infrastructure scripts must be version-controlled in GitHub.
* Access permissions and credentials should be approved before use.
* Use secure practices when managing configuration or deployment keys.

## 9. **Compliance & Security**

* Follow security best practices for all integrations and APIs.
* Use secure credentials and enable 2FA on all project accounts.
* Do not share confidential or client data outside official channels.
* Ensure compliance with GDPR and applicable data privacy laws.
