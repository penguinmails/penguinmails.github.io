## Related API Endpoints

| Route | Related API | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/settings/profile` | **NileDB SDK** | `updateUser()` for profile changes. |
| `/settings/organization` | [Workspaces API](/docs/implementation-technical/api/tenant-api/workspaces) | `PATCH /api/v1/tenant/workspaces/{id}` (Update Org details). |
| `/settings/team` | [Workspaces API](/docs/implementation-technical/api/tenant-api/workspaces) | `GET /api/v1/tenant/workspaces/{id}/members` (List), `POST` (Invite). |

## 6. Data Strategy

- **Fetching Method**:
  - **Profile/Org/Team**: Server Components.
  - **Billing**: Server Component (proxies Stripe data).
- **Caching**:
  - **Profile**: Cached for session.
  - **Billing**: No caching (must be accurate).
- **Security**:
  - **Sensitive Data**: API keys and billing info never stored in client state/localStorage.
  - **Re-authentication**: Critical actions (change password, delete workspace) require sudo mode (re-enter password).

## 7. Edge Cases & Error Handling

- **Stripe Session Expired**: If billing portal link expires, show "Session expired. Refresh page to continue."
- **Email Already Taken**: When updating profile email, if email exists, show "Email already in use."
- **Payment Method Failed**: If card declined during plan upgrade, show Stripe error message + "Update payment method" link.
- **Downgrade Restrictions**: If downgrading would exceed new plan limits (e.g., 10 workspaces → 3), block and show "Remove 7 workspaces first."

### Page Components

- **`ProfileForm`** (Client)
  - Features: Avatar upload, password change (requires re-auth).
