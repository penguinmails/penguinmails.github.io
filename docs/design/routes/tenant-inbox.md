- **Layout**: Global Context (Full Height).

## 3. Route Specifications

| Route | Access | Purpose | State/Data Requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/dashboard/inbox` | Tenant | Inbox Root | **Client Component**. Fetches initial threads. Subscribes to real-time updates (WebSocket/Polling) for new messages. |

## 5. Related API Endpoints

| Route | Related API | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/inbox` | [Inbox API](/docs/implementation-technical/api/tenant-api/inbox) | `GET /api/v1/tenant/inbox/threads` (List threads). |
| `/inbox/[threadId]` | [Inbox API](/docs/implementation-technical/api/tenant-api/inbox) | `GET /api/v1/tenant/inbox/threads/{id}` (Thread details). |
| `/inbox/[threadId]/reply` | [Inbox API](/docs/implementation-technical/api/tenant-api/inbox) | `POST /api/v1/tenant/inbox/threads/{id}/reply` (Send reply). |
| `/inbox/ws` | [Inbox API](/docs/implementation-technical/api/tenant-api/inbox) | WebSocket endpoint for real-time updates. |

## 6. Data Strategy

- **Fetching Method**:

  - **Initial Load**: Client-side fetch (`useSWR` or `react-query`) to populate thread list.

  - **Real-time**: WebSocket connection pushes `NEW_MESSAGE` and `THREAD_UPDATED` events.

- **Caching**:

  - **Thread List**: Cached in memory (SWR cache).

  - **Offline Support**: `IndexedDB` stores last 50 threads for offline viewing.

- **Optimistic Updates**:

  - **Sending Reply**: Message appears in chat immediately with "Sending..." status.

  - **Archive/Delete**: Thread removed from list immediately.

- **State Management**:

  - **Unread Counts**: Global context updated via WebSocket events.

## 7. Edge Cases & Error Handling

- **WebSocket Disconnect**: Show "Reconnecting..." badge. Fallback to polling.

- **Send Failure**: If reply fails, show red "Failed to send" icon with "Retry" button.

- **Thread Not Found**: If accessing deleted thread via URL, redirect to Inbox root.

- **Concurrent Reply**: If another user replies to same thread, show new message immediately to avoid double-reply.

## 8. Component Architecture

### Page Components

- **`InboxLayout`** (Client)

  - Manages split-pane layout (ThreadList | ChatWindow).

  - Handles WebSocket connection context.

- **`ThreadList`** (Client)

  - Props: `initialThreads: Thread[]`

  - Features: Virtualized list (react-window), search filter, unread indicators.

- **`ChatWindow`** (Client)

  - Props: `activeThreadId: string`

  - Sub-components: `MessageBubble`, `ReplyComposer`, `LeadContextSidebar`

### Shared Components

## 9. Implementation Status & MVP Gaps

### Current Status

**Documentation**: Complete route specifications with comprehensive UI patterns and component architecture.

**Implementation**: Pending architecture spike completion.

### Critical Blocker: Stalwart Integration

**Problem**: The inbox architecture proposes custom tables (`inbox_threads`, `inbox_messages`) without investigating how they integrate with Stalwart Mail Server's existing PostgreSQL schema.

**Required Investigation** (Q4 2025 - 3-5 days):

- Can we extend Stalwart's schema with custom fields?

- Should inbox metadata live in OLTP, Content DB, or Stalwart's database?

- How does Stalwart store emails and can we add foreign keys?

**Impact**: This architectural decision blocks all inbox development.

### MVP Gaps (Q1 2026 - Post-Spike)

Once the Stalwart investigation is complete, the following features need implementation:

1. **Email Threading Algorithm** (1-2 weeks)

   - Match replies using RFC 5322 headers (References, In-Reply-To)

   - Fallback to Subject + Contact matching

   - Handle edge cases (forwarded emails, subject changes)

2. **Star/Favorite Feature** (2-3 days)

   - Add star icon to thread list UI

   - Create "Starred" folder view

   - Implement star/unstar API endpoint

3. **Folder/View System** (3-5 days)

   - Implement All, Starred, Sent, Archived, Trash views

   - Add "Archive" and "Delete" actions with bulk support

   - Implement soft delete (trash folder, permanent delete after 30 days)

4. **Attachment Support** (1-2 days documentation)

   - Document integration with existing Content DB attachments table

   - Add file upload UI specifications

   - Document file size limits (25 MB per attachment)

5. **Browser Notifications** (1-2 days integration)

   - Integrate with existing Notifications Database

   - Request browser notification permission on first inbox visit

   - Create notification when new reply arrives

**Total MVP Effort**: Unknown until Stalwart spike complete (estimated 2-4 weeks post-spike)

### Post-MVP Enhancements (Q2-Q3 2026)

### Q2 2026: AI Features

- Smart Reply Suggestions (Gemini AI) - 1-2 weeks

- Sentiment Analysis & Tone Detection - 3-5 days

- Advanced Inbox Analytics - 3-4 weeks

- Scheduled Sending - 3-5 days

- Lead Context Sidebar - 2-3 weeks

### Q3 2026: International Feature

- Offline Support (IndexedDB) - 3-5 days

- Multi-Language Support & Translation - 1-2 weeks
