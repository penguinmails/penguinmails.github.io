# Core Application Structure

## 1. Purpose & Context (The "Why")

* **Goal**: Define the shell of the application that persists across views, handling navigation, context switching, and global state.
* **Feature References**:
  * [Frontend Routing Map](/docs/design/frontend-routing-map)
* **User Journey**: The user spends 100% of their authenticated time within this shell. It must be responsive and context-aware.

## 2. UI Patterns & Components (The "How")

* **Core Components**:
  * `Sidebar`: Collapsible, context-aware navigation tree.
  * `Topbar`: Breadcrumbs, Global Search, User Menu.
  * `ContextSwitcher`: Dropdown in Sidebar header to switch between Workspaces.
* **Layout**: `DashboardLayout` (Shell).

## 3. Route Specifications

| Route | Access | Purpose | State/Data Requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/dashboard` | Auth | Layout Wrapper | **Server Component**. Fetches User Profile + List of accessible Workspaces. Hydrates Client Context. |
| `/dashboard/*` | Auth | Nested Routes | Renders children within the `DashboardLayout`. Handles loading states via `loading.tsx` (Suspense). |

### Navigation Logic

* **Global Context**: When at `/dashboard` root or global tools (Inbox, Leads), Sidebar shows global nav items.
* **Workspace Context**: When at `/dashboard/workspaces/[slug]`, Sidebar switches to Workspace-specific items (Campaigns, Templates, etc.).
* **Breadcrumbs**: Auto-generated based on URL segments.

## 4. Detailed View Descriptions

### `/dashboard` - Application Shell

**User Story**: *"As a user, I need a consistent navigation structure that adapts to my current context (global vs. workspace), so I can efficiently access all features without getting lost."*

**What You'll Find**:

* **Sidebar (Left Panel)**:
  * **Logo & Context Switcher**: Dropdown showing current workspace or "Global View".
  * **Navigation Tree**:
    * Global Context: Dashboard, Inbox, Leads, Workspaces, Settings.
    * Workspace Context: Overview, Campaigns, Templates, Domains, Settings.
  * **Collapse Button**: Minimize sidebar to icon-only mode for more screen space.

* **Topbar (Horizontal)**:
  * **Breadcrumbs**: `Dashboard > Workspaces > Client A > Campaigns`.
  * **Global Search**: Quick access to campaigns, leads, templates (Cmd+K shortcut).
  * **Notifications Bell**: Unread count badge, dropdown with recent activity.
  * **User Menu**: Avatar with dropdown (Profile, Billing, Logout).

* **Main Content Area**:
  * Renders children routes.
  * **Loading State**: Skeleton screens during Suspense boundaries.

**User Journey Context**: Persistent shell for all authenticated views. Optimized for daily power users who navigate frequently.

* [Navigation Patterns](/docs/design/ui-library#navigation)
* [Layout Components](/docs/design/component-library#layouts)

**Technical Integration**:

* **Server Component**: Fetches User Profile + Workspaces list on server.
* **Client Context**: Hydrates React Context with user data for client components.
* **Middleware Protection**: All `/dashboard/*` routes protected by auth middleware.

### Context Switching Behavior

**User Story**: *"As an agency owner managing multiple clients, I want to seamlessly switch between different workspaces without losing my place, so I can efficiently multitask across accounts."*

**How It Works**:

1. **Dropdown in Sidebar Header**: Shows all accessible workspaces.
2. **Click to Switch**: Updates URL to `/dashboard/workspaces/[new-slug]` without full page reload (client-side navigation).
3. **Sidebar Rehydrates**: Navigation items update to show workspace-specific routes.
4. **Persisted State**: Last viewed workspace stored in localStorage for return visits.

**Edge Cases**:

* User with only 1 workspace: Context switcher hidden, always in workspace mode.
* User with 20+ workspaces: Dropdown becomes searchable for quick filtering.

### Loading & Error States

**User Story**: *"As a user on a slow connection, I want to see clear loading indicators, so I know the app is working and not frozen."*

**Loading Patterns**:

* **Initial Load**: Full-page spinner with PenguinMails logo.
* **Route Navigation**: Top progress bar (NProgress.js style).
* **Suspense Boundaries**: Skeleton screens for main content area.

**Error Patterns**:

* **Network Error**: "Connection lost. Retrying..." banner at top.
* **404 on Child Route**: "Page not found" in main content, sidebar remains active.
* **Auth Expired**: Auto-redirect to `/login` with `?redirect=/dashboard/...` query.

* [Loading States](/docs/design/design-system#feedback)

## 5. Related API Endpoints

| Route | Related API | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/dashboard` | [Workspaces API](/docs/implementation-technical/api/tenant-api/workspaces) | `GET /api/v1/tenant/workspaces` used to populate the sidebar context switcher. |
| `/dashboard` | **NileDB SDK** | `getUser()` used to hydrate user profile in the Topbar. |

## 6. Data Strategy

* **Fetching Method**:
* **Fetching Method**:
  * **Server Components**: The root layout fetches the user profile and list of workspaces.
  * **Parallel Fetching**: `Promise.all([getUser(), getWorkspaces()])` to minimize waterfall.
* **Caching**:
  * Workspace list cached for 1 minute or invalidated on workspace creation/deletion.
  * User profile cached for session duration (unless updated).
* **State Management**:
  * **Global Context**: `UserContext` and `WorkspaceContext` providers wrap the application.
  * **URL State**: Workspace slug in URL (`/dashboard/workspaces/[slug]`) drives the current context.

## 7. Edge Cases & Error Handling

* **Workspace Not Found**: Accessing `/dashboard/workspaces/invalid-slug` -> Redirects to `/dashboard` (Global View) with "Workspace not found" toast.
* **No Access**: Accessing a valid workspace the user doesn't belong to -> 403 Forbidden Page.
* **Session Expiry**: API 401 response -> Middleware redirects to `/login?redirect=...`.
* **Deleted Workspace**: If current workspace is deleted by another admin, real-time event or next fetch redirects user to `/dashboard`.

## 8. Component Architecture
