# Workspace Management

## 1. Purpose & Context (The "Why")

- **Goal**: Create and configure workspaces (sub-tenants/clients). Crucial for Agencies.

- **Feature References**:

  - [Agency Features](/docs/business/user-personas/agency-owners)

- **User Journey**: Agency signs up → Creates Workspace for "Client A" → Invites Client A users.

## 2. UI Patterns & Components (The "How")

- **Core Components**:

  - `CardGrid`: Visual list of workspaces with health status.

  - `Modal`: For "Create Workspace" flow.

  - `Tabs`: For Workspace Settings (General, Members, Billing).

- **Analytics Patterns**:

  - `DataCard`: "Client Health" summary on the card (e.g., " 3 Active Campaigns").

- **Layout**: Global Context.

## 3. Route Specifications

| Route | Access | Purpose | State/Data Requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/dashboard/workspaces` | Tenant/Agency | Workspace List | **Server Component**. List of all accessible workspaces. Agency view shows aggregated stats (Total Revenue, Active Clients). |

| `/dashboard/workspaces/[slug]/settings` | Admin | Workspace Config | Settings for the specific workspace. Rename, Delete, Transfer Ownership. |

## 5. Related API Endpoints

| Route | Related API | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/workspaces` | [Workspaces API](/docs/implementation-technical/api/tenant-api/workspaces) | `GET /api/v1/tenant/workspaces` (List), `POST` (Create). |
| `/workspaces/[slug]` | [Workspaces API](/docs/implementation-technical/api/tenant-api/workspaces) | `GET /api/v1/tenant/workspaces/{id}` (Details & Stats). |
| `/workspaces/[slug]/settings` | [Workspaces API](/docs/implementation-technical/api/tenant-api/workspaces) | `PATCH /api/v1/tenant/workspaces/{id}` (Update settings). |
| `/workspaces/[slug]/members` | [Workspaces API](/docs/implementation-technical/api/tenant-api/workspaces) | `POST /api/v1/tenant/workspaces/{id}/members` (Invite). |

## 6. Data Strategy

- **Fetching Method**:

  - **Workspace List**: Server Component.

  - **Aggregated Stats**: Fetched in parallel with list.

- **Caching**:

  - **Workspace List**: Cached for 1 minute.

  - **Health Scores**: Cached for 1 hour (computed via background job).

- **Optimistic Updates**:

  - "Create Workspace" adds card to grid immediately (with loading state while provisioning).

## 7. Edge Cases & Error Handling

- **Slug Collision**: If auto-generated slug exists, append number (e.g., `acme-corp-1`).

- **Creation Failure**: If background provisioning fails, show error on card and "Retry" action.

- **Last Admin**: Cannot remove self if you are the only admin.

- **Delete Workspace**: Requires typing workspace name to confirm (destructive action).
