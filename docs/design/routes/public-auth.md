# Public & Authentication Routes

## 1. Purpose & Context (The "Why")

* **Goal**: Provide secure entry points for users to access the platform, register, and recover accounts.
* **Feature References**:
  * [User Onboarding](/docs/features/getting-started)
  * [Security & Compliance](/docs/compliance-security/enterprise/overview)
* **User Journey**: These are the first touchpoints. The experience must be fast, trustworthy, and clear.

## 2. UI Patterns & Components (The "How")

* **Core Components**:
  * `AuthLayout`: Specialized layout with split screen (Marketing visual left, Form right).
  * `Form`: Use `react-hook-form` + `zod` for validation (see [UI Library](/docs/design/ui-library)).
  * `Button`: Primary variant for "Sign In"/"Register", Ghost variant for "Forgot Password".
* **Analytics Patterns**: N/A (Operational views).
* **Layout**: `PublicLayout` (Minimal header/footer) or `AuthLayout`.

## 5. Related API Endpoints

| Route | Related API / Service | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/login` | **NileDB SDK** | Handles authentication, session management, and cookie setting. |
| `/register` | **NileDB SDK** | Handles user creation and initial tenant setup. |
| `/forgot-password` | **Loop Service** | Triggers password reset emails via internal service. |
| `/status` | `GET /api/v1/status` | (Internal) System health check endpoint. |

## 6. Data Strategy

* **Fetching Method**:
  * Landing Page (`/`): **Static Site Generation (SSG)**. Built at deploy time.
  * Auth Pages: **Client-side** only. No initial data fetch required (except session check).
  * Status Page: **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** with 60s revalidation.
* **Caching**:
  * Public assets cached via CDN (Cloudflare).
  * API responses for status check cached for 60s.
* **State Management**:
  * Auth state managed via `NileDB` provider context.
  * Form state managed via `react-hook-form`.

## 7. Edge Cases & Error Handling

* **Already Logged In**: Accessing `/login` or `/register` while authenticated redirects to `/dashboard`.
* **Invalid Token**: `/verify-email` or `/reset-password` with expired/invalid token shows clear error message + "Request New Link" button.
* **Rate Limiting**: Too many login attempts triggers 429 Too Many Requests. Show "Try again in X minutes".
* **Network Offline**: Forms disable submission and show "No internet connection" toast.
