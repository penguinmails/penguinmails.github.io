- **Solution**: Check tracking pixel implementation, contact support

- **Prevention**: Verify tracking setup before launch

3. **Data Source Issues**:

   - **Symptom**: Inconsistent data between sources

   - **Solution**: Run data consistency check and ETL verification

   - **Resolution**: Manual data reconciliation if needed

### **Campaign Issues**

#### **"Why is my campaign stuck in 'Draft' status?"**

1. **Incomplete Setup**:

   - **Symptom**: Campaign shows as draft despite clicking "Launch"

   - **Solution**: Check completion checklist - missing content, recipients, or IP selection

   - **Prevention**: System prevents launch until all required fields complete

2. **Validation Errors**:

   - **Symptom**: "Validation failed" message with red indicators

   - **Solution**: Review error messages and fix highlighted issues

   - **Common Issues**: Missing unsubscribe link, invalid email addresses

3. **Account Verification**:

   - **Symptom**: Launch blocked by account status

   - **Solution**: Complete email verification or billing setup

   - **Check**: Account settings show verification status

#### **"Why aren't my emails being delivered?"**

1. **IP Reputation Issues**:

   - **Symptom**: High bounce rates or emails going to spam

   - **Solution**: Check IP reputation dashboard, consider IP rotation

   - **Prevention**: Maintain good sending practices and list hygiene

2. **Content Problems**:

   - **Symptom**: Emails blocked by spam filters

   - **Solution**: Run content through spam checker, simplify subject lines

   - **Prevention**: Follow email best practices and test content

3. **Recipient Issues**:

   - **Symptom**: Individual emails failing to deliver

   - **Solution**: Check recipient email validity, remove bounced addresses

   - **Prevention**: Regular list cleaning and validation

#### **"Why is my campaign sending slowly?"**

1. **Rate Limiting**:

   - **Symptom**: Emails sent in small batches over long time

   - **Solution**: IP warmup in progress or shared IP throttling

   - **Check**: Campaign monitoring shows send rate and progress

2. **Queue Prioritization**:

   - **Symptom**: Other campaigns sending first

   - **Solution**: Check campaign priority settings

   - **Upgrade**: Higher-tier plans get priority queue access

3. **Large Recipient List**:

   - **Symptom**: Naturally slow for 100K+ recipients

   - **Solution**: Expected behavior - monitor progress dashboard

   - **Optimization**: Consider list segmentation for faster delivery

#### **"Why did my campaign get paused automatically?"**

1. **Bounce Rate Threshold**:

   - **Symptom**: Campaign paused due to high bounces

   - **Solution**: Review bounce analysis, clean recipient list

   - **Prevention**: Regular list hygiene and validation

2. **Spam Complaints**:

   - **Symptom**: Too many recipients marked email as spam

   - **Solution**: Improve content relevance, check unsubscribe compliance

   - **Prevention**: Build engaged recipient lists, provide value

3. **Content Violations**:

   - **Symptom**: Spam filter triggered by content

   - **Solution**: Content review and modification

   - **Prevention**: Preview content in multiple email clients

4. **IP Health Issues**:

   - **Symptom**: IP reputation problems

   - **Solution**: IP rotation or reputation rebuilding

   - **Prevention**: Consistent good sending practices
