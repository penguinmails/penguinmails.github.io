## Process Optimization Templates

### Monthly Process Optimization Framework

**Process Assessment Components (Weighted)**:
- Process Efficiency (35%): Cycle time reduction, error rate improvement, resource utilization
- Cross-Domain Integration (25%): Coordination effectiveness, handoff optimization, communication flow
- Performance Monitoring (20%): KPI tracking, trend analysis, improvement identification
- Automation Opportunities (15%): Manual task reduction, workflow streamlining, technology leverage
- Stakeholder Satisfaction (5%): Internal customer feedback, team engagement, collaboration effectiveness

**Optimization Process Ranges**:
- **90-100**: Excellent - Industry-leading performance, expansion opportunity
- **70-89**: Good - Solid performance, optimization potential
- **50-69**: Fair - Improvement needed, systematic approach required
- **Below 50**: Critical - Immediate intervention and redesign needed

**Monthly Review Process**:
1. Assess processes using weighted optimization components
2. Identify processes showing >15% decline from previous month
3. Flag processes in Fair or Critical ranges for intervention
4. Schedule optimization workshops for declining processes
5. Document optimization actions and efficiency gains
