# Automation & Workflows Roadmap

## Feature Deep Dive: Automation & Workflows

### Overview

**Timeline:** Q2-Q3 2026
**Effort:** 12-15 weeks (3-4 engineers)
**Priority:** Medium-High (Critical for competitive differentiation)
**Status:** Planned (0% implementation)

### Current State vs. Target

## What Exists Today

- ✅ Basic campaign sequences (linear email flows)

- ✅ Time-based delays between emails

- ✅ Campaign scheduling and manual triggers

## What's Missing (MVP Scope)

- ❌ Visual workflow builder with drag-and-drop

- ❌ Event tracking infrastructure (email opens, clicks, replies)

- ❌ Conditional logic and branching (if/then/else)

- ❌ Event-based triggers (beyond time)

- ❌ Behavioral automation (contact property changes)

- ❌ Workflow execution engine with error handling

### MVP Implementation Plan (Q2-Q3 2026)

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-5

1. Event Tracking Infrastructure (2-3 weeks) - P0 blocker

2. Workflow Execution Engine (4-5 weeks) - P0 blocker

## Phase 2: User-Facing Features

1. Basic Trigger Library (1 week) - 15+ triggers

2. Basic Action Library (1 week) - 12+ actions

## Phase 3: Workflow Builder (Wee

1. Visual Workflow Builder UI (4-6 weeks) - Drag-and-drop interface

2. Workflow Execution History & Debugging (2-3 weeks) - Monitoring tools

### Post-MVP Roadmap (2026-2027)

- **Q3 2026:** Advanced Conditional Logic (nested conditions, A/B testing)

- **Q4 2026:** AI-Powered Workflow Optimization (send time prediction, churn risk)

- **Q1 2027:** Cross-Channel Automation (email + SMS + push)

- **Q2 2027:** Workflow Templates Marketplace (50+ pre-built templates)

- **Q2 2027:** Zapier Integration (connect to 5,000+ apps)

### Key Dependencies

## Required Before Automation

- Enhanced Analytics (Q1 2026) - Event tracking foundation

- Campaign Management (Q1 2026) - Base campaign infrastructure

- Contact Management - Segmentation and tagging

## Enables Future Features

- Lead Scoring - Automated scoring based on behavior

- Predictive Analytics - ML-powered insights

- Cross-Channel Campaigns - Omnichannel orchestration

### Success Metrics

## Technical

- Event processing latency < 5 seconds

- Workflow execution accuracy 99.9%

- Support 100+ concurrent workflows

- Handle 1000+ events/second

## Business

- 30% reduction in manual campaign management time

- 20% increase in email engagement (vs. linear sequences)

- 15% improvement in lead conversion rates
