# Operational Runbooks

## Daily Operations Procedures

**System Health Monitoring Checklist**
- **Automated Health Checks**: Validate 15 core system health metrics every 15 minutes
- **Performance Baseline Validation**: Compare real-time metrics against established baselines
- **Security Status Review**: Execute automated security scans across 8 critical attack vectors
- **Resource Utilization Analysis**: Monitor CPU, memory, storage, and network utilization trends

**Critical Performance Thresholds** (Weighted 40% System, 25% Security, 20% Performance, 15% User Impact):
- API Response Time: <200ms (95th percentile)
- System Uptime: ≥99.9% availability
- Error Rate: <0.1% across all endpoints
- Security Alerts: <2 critical issues per day

## Weekly Operations Procedures

**Capacity Planning and Scaling Review**
- **Resource Utilization Trending**: Analyze 7-day rolling averages for capacity planning
