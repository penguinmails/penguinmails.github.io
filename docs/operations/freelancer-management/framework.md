## Operational Procedures and Coordination Protocols

This framework provides detailed operational procedures for managing freelancer relationships, ensuring quality delivery, and maintaining professional standards throughout external partnerships.

## Freelancer Engagement Protocols

### Task Assignment and Estimation Process

#### Pre-Assignment Requirements

- **Effort Estimation**: Freelancers must provide effort estimates (in effort points) and delivery timeframes before accepting any task
- **Capability Assessment**: Verify freelancer competency for assigned work type and technical requirements
