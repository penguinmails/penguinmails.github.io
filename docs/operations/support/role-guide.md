## QA Role

**Purpose**: Testing role for validating features, bug reproduction, and quality assurance without affecting production data.

### Access Level

| Permission | Access |
|------------|---------|
| Sandbox environment | ✅ Yes - Full access to test environment |

- Generate test users with fake email addresses
- Populate test data (campaigns, leads, emails)

### Feature Flag Testing

- Enable/disable beta features in sandbox
- Test feature variations
- Validate feature behavior before production

### Sandbox Data Reset

- Reset sandbox to clean state
- Clear all test data
- Restore default configuration

### Bug Reproduction

- Replicate production issues in sandbox
- Test bug fixes before deployment
- Document reproduction steps

### Routes

- `/dashboard/qa/*` - QA panel interface
- `/dashboard/qa/sandbox` - Sandbox management
- `/dashboard/qa/features` - Feature flag control
- `/dashboard/qa/test-data` - Test data generation

### Environment Separation

**Sandbox Environment**:

- Isolated PostgreSQL database (separate schema)
- Dedicated Redis instance
- Test SMTP servers (no real emails sent)
- Synthetic data only

**Production Environment**:

- QA role has **no access**
- Read-only view for monitoring (via shared dashboards)
- Cannot execute actions

## Role Comparison Matrix

| Feature | super_admin | admin | support | qa | Tenant Owner |
|---------|-------------|-------|---------|----|--------------|\n| Platform-wide access | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Access Control Implementation

**Database Level**:

- Row-level security (RLS) policies enforce access restrictions
- Support role cannot query PII columns
- QA role limited to sandbox schema

**API Level**:

- Middleware checks role before executing actions
- Support endpoints return redacted PII
- QA endpoints only work in sandbox mode

**UI Level**:

- Role-based component rendering
- Sensitive fields hidden from support view
- QA panel only visible in sandbox environment

**Audit Logging**:

- All support access logged with timestamp, user, reason
- QA actions logged separately from production
- Support ticket ID linked to audit events

---

## Best Practices

### For Support Staff

1. **Always link actions to tickets**: Document why you're accessing tenant data
2. **Use internal notes**: Don't expose internal details to tenants
3. **Escalate when needed**: Transfer to super_admin for data modifications
4. **Respect PII boundaries**: Never screenshot or share protected data

### For QA Staff

1. **Never test in production**: Always use sandbox environment
2. **Reset after testing**: Clean up test data to keep sandbox usable
3. **Document reproductions**: Create detailed bug reports with steps
4. **Validate fixes**: Confirm bug fixes work before production deployment
