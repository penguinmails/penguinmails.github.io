## Marketing Team Roles and Responsibilities

### Marketing Team Focus

Marketing teams are primarily focused on B2B sales of subscription services to new tenants (clients). Technical implementation and complex customer support remain separate from marketing responsibilities. Marketing's value creation comes through three clear categories:

- **Information Access:** Access to client data from `companies` table plus basic derived metrics for sales qualification
- **Analysis:** Simple derived metrics for lead scoring, churn risk indicators, and lifecycle stage determination
- **Marketing Actions:** Lead generation, sales enablement materials, and third-party automation tools for campaign execution

### Marketing Team Information Requirements

Marketing teams require access to three categories of information for effective B2B sales execution:

**Information Access:**

- Basic client data from `companies` table (required fields only)
- Simple derived metrics: subscription status, usage patterns, basic activity indicators
- Optional enrichment fields: industry, company size (when available, not guaranteed)

**Analysis Capabilities:**

- Lead scoring based on subscription status and usage patterns
- Churn risk indicators (inactive periods, reduced usage)
- Lifecycle stages derived from subscription + usage data
- Basic reporting on client health and engagement

**Marketing Actions Support:**

- Third-party automation tools for email campaigns and lead nurturing
- Sales enablement materials and competitive positioning content
- Integration with CRM systems for pipeline tracking
- Basic performance metrics for campaign effectiveness
