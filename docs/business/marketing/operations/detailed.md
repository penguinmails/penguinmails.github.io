## Operations Capability Framework (Business-Focused)

### Workflow and Process Ownership

This section defines what Marketing Operations must achieve, without prescribing specific tools or code-level automation.

**Campaign Operations:**
- Standardize planning, launch, monitoring, and close-out checklists
- Ensure every campaign has defined owner and approvals, documented KPIs and reporting cadence, clear handoffs between Marketing, Sales, and Product
- Require that technical automation aligns to these standards (implemented in Level 4 docs)

**Content Operations:**
- Govern content intake, review, approval, and publishing processes
- Maintain shared calendars and SLAs for request turnaround
- Define quality and compliance checkpoints for all outbound content

**Lead Management Operations:**
- Define business rules for lead qualification thresholds, routing policies to Sales/CS, nurture track assignment and exit criteria
- Require reporting on lead aging, conversion, and leakage

### Operations Excellence Metrics (Business-Level)

Define outcome KPIs Marketing Operations is accountable for; technical SLO/SLA details are documented in Level 4.

**Core Performance Standards:**
- **Automation Coverage:** 80% of marketing processes automated within 18 months
- **Process Standardization:** 90% of marketing processes standardized and documented
- **Workflow Optimization:** 70% reduction in manual marketing workflow time
- **Quality Improvement:** 95% improvement in marketing process quality and consistency
- **Efficiency and Productivity:** 50% improvement in marketing team productivity, 35% improvement in overall marketing performance
