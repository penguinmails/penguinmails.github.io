### ROI Calculation Framework

```
Financial Services Marketing ROI Formula:
ROI = (Client Lifetime Value - Customer Acquisition Cost) / Customer Acquisition Cost × 100

Client Lifetime Value Calculation:
CLV = (Average Annual Revenue per Client) × (Average Client Relationship Length) - (Service Delivery Costs)
```

**Example ROI Calculation:**
```
Marketing Investment: $500,000
New Clients Acquired: 200
Average Annual Revenue per Client: $8,500
Average Client Relationship: 10 years
Service Delivery Cost per Client: $2,000/year

Client Lifetime Value = ($8,500 × 10) - ($2,000 × 10) = $65,000
ROI = ($65,000 × 200 - $500,000) / $500,000 × 100 = 2,500%
```
