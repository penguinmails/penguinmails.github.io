## E-commerce Marketing ROI Framework

### E-commerce-Specific ROI Metrics

#### Revenue Metrics
- **Average Order Value (AOV):** Revenue per transaction
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** Total revenue from customer over relationship
- **Repeat Purchase Rate:** Percentage of customers who make multiple purchases
- **Conversion Rate:** Percentage of visitors who complete purchases

#### Engagement Metrics

- **Pages per Session:** Depth of customer exploration
- **Return Visitor Rate:** Measure of customer retention

### ROI Calculation Framework

```
E-commerce Marketing ROI Formula:
ROI = (Revenue from Marketing - Marketing Investment) / Marketing Investment × 100

Customer Lifetime Value Calculation:
CLV = (Average Order Value) × (Purchase Frequency) × (Customer Lifespan) × (Profit Margin)
```

**Example ROI Calculation:**
```
Monthly Marketing Investment: $50,000
New Customers Acquired: 1,000
Average Order Value: $85
Monthly Purchase Frequency: 1.2
Customer Lifespan: 24 months
Profit Margin: 25%

CLV = $85 × 1.2 × 24 × 0.25 = $612
Monthly Revenue from New Customers = 1,000 × $612 = $612,000
ROI = ($612,000 - $50,000) / $50,000 × 100 = 1,124%
```
