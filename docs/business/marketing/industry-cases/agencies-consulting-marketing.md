## Professional Services Marketing ROI Framework

### Professional Services-Specific ROI Metrics

#### Business Development ROI

### ROI Calculation Framework

```markdown
Professional Services Marketing ROI Formula:
ROI = (Total Project Revenue - (Marketing Investment + Project Delivery Costs)) / Marketing Investment × 100

Client Lifetime Value Calculation:
CLV = (Average Annual Project Revenue) × (Average Client Relationship Length) × (Profit Margin) - (Ongoing Relationship Costs)
```

**Example ROI Calculation:**

```markdown
Annual Marketing Investment: $750,000
New Clients Acquired: 50
Average Annual Project Revenue per Client: $125,000
Average Client Relationship Length: 4 years
Project Delivery Costs (40% of revenue): $50,000 per client per year
Profit Margin: 30%

Client Lifetime Value = ($125,000 × 4 × 0.30) - ($0) = $150,000
Total New Client Revenue = 50 × $150,000 = $7,500,000
ROI = ($7,500,000 - $750,000) / $750,000 × 100 = 900%
