## SaaS Marketing ROI Framework

### SaaS-Specific ROI Metrics

#### Growth Metrics
- **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):** Predictable monthly subscription revenue
- **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR):** Annualized subscription revenue
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** Total revenue from customer over relationship
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** Total marketing and sales cost per customer

#### Retention Metrics
- **Monthly Churn Rate:** Percentage of customers lost each month
- **Net Revenue Retention:** Revenue retention including expansions and contractions
- **Logo Retention:** Percentage of customer accounts retained
- **Cohort Analysis:** Customer behavior and retention by acquisition cohort

#### Expansion Metrics
- **Net Dollar Retention:** Revenue growth from existing customers
- **Expansion Revenue:** Additional revenue from customer expansions
- **Upsell Rate:** Percentage of customers who upgrade to higher tiers
- **Cross-sell Success:** Additional products sold to existing customers

### ROI Calculation Framework

```
SaaS Marketing ROI Formula:
ROI = (Customer Lifetime Value - Customer Acquisition Cost) / Customer Acquisition Cost × 100

Customer Lifetime Value Calculation:
CLV = (Average Monthly Revenue per Customer) × (Gross Margin %) / (Monthly Churn Rate)

Payback Period:
Payback Period = Customer Acquisition Cost / (Monthly Revenue per Customer × Gross Margin %)
```

**Example ROI Calculation:**
```
Monthly Marketing Investment: $100,000
New Customers Acquired: 200
Average Monthly Revenue per Customer: $500
Gross Margin: 80%
Monthly Churn Rate: 5%

Customer Lifetime Value = ($500 × 0.80) / 0.05 = $8,000
Customer Acquisition Cost = $100,000 / 200 = $500
ROI = ($8,000 - $500) / $500 × 100 = 1,500%
Payback Period = $500 / ($500 × 0.80) = 1.25 months
```
