## Competitive Deliverability Benchmarking (Marketing-Owned)

To support strong, defensible market positioning, marketing leadership will maintain a structured view of how PenguinMails’ deliverability performance compares to alternative providers.

### Strategic Approach

- Marketing and Market Intelligence teams:
  - Conduct regular external benchmarks using:
    - Public and third-party studies,
    - Customer-visible results and case studies,
    - Aggregated, internally validated performance indicators.
  - Translate these findings into:
    - Positioning narratives,
    - Sales enablement materials,
    - Executive talking points.

- This work is:
  - A marketing and strategy responsibility.
  - Informed by internal telemetry where available.
  - Governed by the competitive intelligence framework documented in:
    - [`competitive-analysis-detailed.md`](docs/business/competitive-intelligence/competitive-analysis-detailed.md:1)

### Boundaries

To avoid overstating product capabilities:

- Benchmarks and comparisons:
  - Are presented as curated analysis and directional positioning,
  - Do not imply real-time, global visibility into all providers,
  - Do not represent an in-product “competitive benchmarking engine” or industry index unless explicitly defined elsewhere.

- Internal data (e.g., deliverability and reliability metrics):
  - May be used by Marketing as one input into the narrative,
  - Remains separate from any claim of direct access to competitor systems or proprietary scoring models.

This ensures competitive deliverability benchmarking is clearly understood as a marketing-led, business-facing practice that leverages existing insights without creating hidden technical commitments.
