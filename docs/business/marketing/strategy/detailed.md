## Strategic Implementation and Governance (Business-Focused)

This section defines how strategic initiatives are prioritized, sequenced, and governed at the business level. Detailed schemas, APIs, SLOs, and infrastructure decisions are defined exclusively in Level 4 technical documentation.

### Epic Prioritization and Phasing

- Align epic delivery with:

  - Board-approved growth and profitability targets

  - CMO strategic themes from `docs/business/marketing/strategy/overview.md`

  - Financial guardrails defined in `docs/business/marketing/roi/detailed.md`

- Use 12–18 month rolling roadmap with:

  - Clear epic ownership

  - Quarterly checkpoints for scope and value realization

  - Dependency visibility to Implementation and Operations stakeholders

### Governance and Decision Rights (Business Scope)

- **CMO:**

  - Owns approval of epic priorities and funding envelopes

  - Sets non-functional expectations as business outcomes without prescribing stack choices

- **Marketing Directors:**

  - Translate epic intent into portfolio of initiatives and campaigns

  - Ensure initiatives remain aligned with Level 1 summaries and this Level 3 strategy

- **Marketing Operations:**

  - Ensures processes, SLAs, and operating models can support epics at scale

  - Escalates structural gaps to implementation owners rather than dictating technical patterns

### Alignment with Technical Implementation (Pointers Only)

For each epic, detailed implementation is maintained in Level 4 technical specifications:

- **Epic 1 (Foundation):** See technical implementation: `docs/implementation-technical/marketing/analytics-integration/marketing-analytics-architecture.md`

- **Epic 2 (Campaign Performance):** See technical implementation: `docs/implementation-technical/marketing/ai/marketing-optimization-engine-specification.md`

- **Epic 3 (Customer Journey Optimization):** See technical implementation: `docs/implementation-technical/marketing/personalization/marketing-personalization-engine-specification.md`

- **Epic 4 (Marketing Intelligence):** See technical implementation: `docs/implementation-technical/marketing/analytics-integration/marketing-analytics-architecture.md`

All low-level implementation guidance (APIs, data models, infrastructure) is out of scope for this Level 3 strategy document and must reside in the corresponding Level 4 technical docs.
