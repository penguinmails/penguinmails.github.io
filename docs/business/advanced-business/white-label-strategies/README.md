# White Label Strategy Hub

## Overview

White-label partnerships extend PenguinMails into agency-led revenue channels by packaging multi-tenant infrastructure, compliance automation, and revenue-sharing models into an agency-branded experience. The documents in this folder break the strategy into market intelligence, implementation programs, financial models, and operational runbooks so teams can adopt, scale, and govern white-label deployments.

## Key Outcomes

- Expand agency revenue through aligned pricing and revenue-share incentives.
- Reduce onboarding friction with prescriptive implementation phases and migration workflows.
- Maintain compliance and deliverability benchmarks across diverse agency client portfolios.
- Track performance with shared metrics, risk guardrails, and growth roadmaps.
