# White Label Risk Management

## Market Risks

### Competition from Well-Funded Providers

- **Risk**: Major ESPs launch agency-focused offerings.
- **Mitigation**: Leverage first-mover advantage in revenue sharing, secure patent coverage where applicable, and accelerate roadmap delivery informed by partner feedback.

### Regulatory Shifts

- **Risk**: New privacy or anti-spam laws increase compliance complexity.
- **Mitigation**: Maintain compliance-first architecture with automated policy packs, and lead industry dialogue on emerging regulations.

### Technology Disruption

- **Risk**: Deliverability algorithm changes across inbox providers diminish campaign effectiveness.
- **Mitigation**: Invest in ongoing R&D, diversify infrastructure across providers, and deploy AI-driven diagnostics to adapt quickly.

## Business Model Risks

### Agency Dependency

- **Risk**: Over-reliance on agency channel for net-new revenue.
- **Mitigation**: Balance portfolio to 60% white-label, 40% direct sales by year two, and create shared marketing plans that drive mutual pipeline.

### Revenue Concentration

- **Risk**: Top agencies representing more than 30% of white-label revenue.
- **Mitigation**: Build a diverse agency base across geographies and verticals; enforce performance standards and succession plans for key partners.

## Operational Practices

- Maintain early-warning dashboards covering deliverability, compliance, and revenue health.
- Schedule semi-annual risk reviews with stakeholders across product, compliance, and finance.
- Document incident response runbooks for agency churn, regulatory updates, and infrastructure disruptions.
