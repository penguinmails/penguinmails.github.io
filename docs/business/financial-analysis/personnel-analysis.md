## ⏰ Weekly Time Requirements by Scale

### Time Breakdown by Function and Scale

| Scale | Function | Hours/Week | Primary Activities | Assumptions/Sources |
|-------|----------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Small (1K-10K/mo)** | Campaign Setup & Copy | 3–5 | Draft 1–2 email sequences, A/B test variants, subject line testing | Email copywriting 20–30 min/email × 2–3 sequences; A/B testing overhead |
| **Small (1K-10K/mo)** | List Management | 2–4 | Weekly list audits, validation, segmentation by engagement/vertical | Manual list scrubbing + email validation tools; smaller lists need less automation |
| **Small (1K-10K/mo)** | Deliverability Monitoring | 1–2 | Weekly email health check (bounce rate <1%, spam complaints <0.1%), open rate trending | Klaviyo guidance: weekly 30-day metric review; list size allows manual monitoring |
| **Small (1K-10K/mo)** | Reporting & Optimization | 2–3 | Weekly analytics review, 1–2 A/B tests running, CTR/reply rate analysis | 48–72 hour wait for statistical significance; limited concurrent tests |
| **Medium (10K-100K/mo)** | Campaign Setup & Copy | 6–10 | Draft 3–5 sequences/variants, multiple concurrent A/B tests, personalization setup | Copywriting scaled across 3–5 sequences; multiple concurrent test cadence |
| **Medium (10K-100K/mo)** | List Management | 4–8 | 2–3 weekly list builds/enrichment, segment management, lead quality audits | Reddit case study (50K/mo): $147 cleaning cost implies ≈4 hours weekly list work |
| **Medium (10K-100K/mo)** | Deliverability Monitoring | 3–5 | Daily reputation monitoring, ISP-specific inbox placement checks, SPF/DKIM validation | Instantly best practices: daily health score monitoring + 2–3 domain checks |
| **Medium (10K-100K/mo)** | Reporting & Optimization | 4–6 | Daily/bi-daily reporting, multivariate testing analysis, account/domain diagnostics | Bento calculator: segmented send planning; Litmus guidance on test timing |
| **Large (100K+/mo)** | Campaign Setup & Copy | 8–15 | Multi-sequence coordination, advanced personalization, copywriting optimization | Intuit/Square: rapid experimentation requiring dedicated test cycles; scaling challenges |
| **Large (100K+/mo)** | List Management | 6–12 | Continuous list operations, advanced segmentation, daily lead sourcing | Reddit case study: 1,500/day = 6,000+ weekly requires automated list operations |
| **Large (100K+/mo)** | Deliverability Monitoring | 5–8 | Continuous infrastructure health (reputation, authentication, ISP relationships) | SPF/DKIM/DMARC: 30 min–1 hr per domain; monitoring 2–3 hrs/week |
| **Large (100K+/mo)** | Reporting & Optimization | 6–10 | Real-time analytics, advanced cohort analysis, daily optimization cycles | Complex multivariate testing, ISP-level performance analysis, daily optimization |

### Total Weekly Hours and FTE Equivalent

| Scale | Low Hours/Week | Mid Hours/Week | High Hours/Week | FTE Equivalent (Mid) | Recommended Staffing |
|-------|---------------|----------------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Small (1K-10K/mo)** | 8 | 10 | 14 | 0.3 FTE (1.5–2 days/wk) | 1 part-time coordinator or fractional specialist |
| **Medium (10K-100K/mo)** | 17 | 23 | 29 | 0.6 FTE (3 days/wk) | 1 FTE email ops + part-time analyst |
| **Large (100K+/mo)** | 25 | 37 | 43 | 0.9+ FTE (dedicated team) | 2 FTE minimum (ops lead + senior specialist + analyst) |

### Time Scaling Analysis

#### Key Implementation Insights
- **Automation Impact**: Small programs reduce hours by 20-30% through list automation and A/B testing
- **Scaling Non-Linearity**: Time doesn't scale linearly with email volume; 10× volume increase requires only 3-5× additional time
- **Benchmarking Considerations**: Initial setup (first 4-6 weeks) runs 15-25% higher as infrastructure is built and processes documented

#### Efficiency Improvement by Scale
- **Small Scale**: 20-30% efficiency gains from basic automation
- **Medium Scale**: 30-40% efficiency gains from automation integration
- **Large Scale**: 40-50% efficiency gains require significant infrastructure investment
