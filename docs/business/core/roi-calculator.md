## Executive Decision Framework

### When to Choose Managed ESPs

- Volume < 1M emails/month

- Deliverability is business critical

- No dedicated DevOps team

- Need built-in compliance and security

- Want predictable costs and support

### When to Consider Self-Hosted

- Volume > 10M emails/month

- Have 4-6+ email infrastructure engineers

- Email is core product (not just marketing)

- Need complete infrastructure control

- Have complex custom requirements

| Phase | Volume Target | Investment | Break-Even Timeline |
