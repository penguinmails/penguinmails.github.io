# Performance Optimization

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Query Performance Enhancement

#### Database Optimization

```yaml
Performance Optimization:
  Query Optimization:

    - Index strategy optimization


    - Query plan analysis


    - Cache utilization


    - Parallel processing

  Data Partitioning:

    - Time-based partitioning


    - Account-based partitioning


    - Geographic partitioning


    - Industry-based partitioning

  Aggregation Strategies:

    - Pre-calculated metrics


    - Materialized views


    - Incremental updates


    - Background processing

```

### 2. Scalability Framework

#### Horizontal and Vertical Scaling

```yaml
Scalability Architecture:
  Horizontal Scaling:

    - Multi-node cluster setup


    - Load balancing optimization


    - Geographic distribution


    - Auto-scaling policies

  Vertical Scaling:

    - Memory optimization


    - CPU utilization enhancement


    - Storage performance tuning


    - Network optimization

  Performance Monitoring:

    - Query performance tracking


    - Resource utilization monitoring


    - User experience measurement


    - System health assessment

```
