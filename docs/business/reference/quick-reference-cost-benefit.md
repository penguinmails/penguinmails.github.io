## Executive Summary: The Business Case

### The Problem

- **Current State**: Organizations spend $4,000-6,400/month on email infrastructure
- **Efficiency Gap**: 60-80% of costs are operational overhead (not infrastructure)
- **Risk Exposure**: $50,000+ per CAN-SPAM violation, €20M GDPR fines
- **Opportunity Cost**: Poor deliverability = 15-25% fewer responses

- **Built-in Compliance**: Automated GDPR, CAN-SPAM, CCPA compliance
- **Operational Savings**: 60-80% reduction in management overhead
- **Performance Improvement**: 15-25% better deliverability rates

### The Return

- **Immediate Savings**: $2,000-5,000)
- **Annual Impact**: $24,000-60,000 cost reduction
- **Risk Mitigation**: Compliance violation cost avoidance
- **Revenue Impact**: 15-25% more email responses = significant revenue
