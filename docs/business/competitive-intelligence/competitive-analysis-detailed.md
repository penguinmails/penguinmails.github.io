## Implementation Boundary: Competitive Deliverability Benchmarking (RP-007 Alignment)

To prevent accidental overpromising and to keep responsibilities clear, all "Competitive Deliverability Benchmarking" (including Story RP-007) is governed by the following rules:

1. Ownership

- Primary:
  - Marketing / Market Intelligence
  - Revenue Operations
  - Strategy / Executive Office
- Supporting (advisory only):
  - Product and Engineering, limited to:
    - Exposing factual, already-implemented internal metrics and views (e.g., deliverability, reputation, infra health from RP-001, RP-003, BF-008),
    - Reviewing external-facing claims for technical accuracy.
- Explicitly NOT:
  - A core engineering feature commitment to:
    - Build an in-app “competitive benchmarking engine”,
    - Provide automated competitor comparison dashboards,
    - Maintain live industry-wide benchmarks inside the PenguinMails product.

2. Data Sources and Methods

- Allowed inputs:
  - Public and third-party benchmark reports and studies,
  - Customer-visible outcomes and validated case studies,
  - Internal performance metrics (PostHog, OLAP views, provider dashboards, etc.) used internally by Marketing/Strategy.
- Prohibited framings:
  - Do NOT represent:
    - Internal analytics tools (PostHog, Stripe, etc.),
    - Provider consoles (e.g., ESP dashboards),
  - As:
    - A bundled “industry benchmark API” for customers,
    - Evidence that PenguinMails sees or controls competitors’ data.

3. Product and Documentation Guardrails

- All documents and GTM assets that mention “competitive deliverability benchmarking” MUST:
  - Frame it as:
    - A Marketing/Strategy-led, periodically updated analysis,
    - Based on curated internal + external evidence.
  - Avoid implying:
    - Real-time, continuous global deliverability visibility,
    - Access to proprietary inbox/ESP scoring models,
    - Any executive/admin UI that exposes authoritative industry-wide metrics, unless:
      - A concrete, separate technical epic explicitly defines and delivers it.
- Where RP-007 is referenced:
  - Treat it as:
    - P2, non-technical, GTM-focused work,
    - Not a hard dependency for platform implementation.
  - Link back to this boundary section as the canonical scope definition.

4. When Engineering Participation IS Appropriate

- Engineering MAY:
  - Provide stable, documented internal signals (e.g., our own deliverability KPIs) for internal analysis by Marketing/Strategy.
- Engineering MUST NOT:
  - Implement or market:
    - Automated ingestion of competitor-confidential data without explicit approved architecture,
    - Hidden or implied access to third-party systems that terms-of-service or infrastructure do not support.

This boundary ensures that RP-007 and related “competitive deliverability” narratives remain truthful, marketing-owned, and aligned with real technical capabilities, while protecting the product backlog from non-implementable expectations.
