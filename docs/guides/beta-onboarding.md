# Beta User Guide: What to Expect

Welcome to the PenguinMails Beta! 👋

First off, **thank you**. By joining us at this early stage, you're not just a user—you're a co-creator. Your feedback will directly shape the future of cold email infrastructure for agencies.

This guide exists to set clear expectations about what you can do right now, what's coming soon, and how we can work together to build the best platform possible.

## 🚧 Current Status: Pre-Launch Beta

PenguinMails is currently in **Private Beta**. This means the core infrastructure is solid, but some bells and whistles are still being polished.

**What this means for you:**

* **Core Functionality is Live**: You can provision VPS instances, set up domains, and send emails. The "plumbing" works.
* **UI is Evolving**: You might see interface changes as we refine the user experience based on your feedback.
* **Manual Steps**: Some actions that will eventually be one-click might currently require two clicks or a quick support chat.

## 📋 Known Limitations (Transparency First)

We believe in radical transparency. Here are the features currently in development or planned for later releases, so you aren't left guessing.

| Feature | Status | Expected Availability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **OAuth / Social Login** | Planned | Q3 2026 |
| **Advanced Team Permissions** | In Progress | Q2 2026 |
| **Native CRM Integrations** | Planned | Q2 2026 (Zapier available sooner) |
| **Mobile App** | Future | 2028+ |

> **Note**: Just because a feature isn't "native" yet doesn't mean you're blocked. Our support team can often help you achieve your goals via workarounds or direct database assistance.

## 🐛 How to Report Bugs & Request Features

We *want* to hear about the bugs. We *need* to hear about the friction points.

### 1. The "Red Phone" (Slack Community)

For the fastest response, use our private Beta Slack channel.

* **Channel**: `#beta-feedback`
* **Best for**: Quick questions, "is this broken?" checks, and high-fives.

### 2. Formal Bug Reports (Email)

For detailed issues or sensitive data:

* **Email**: `beta-support@penguinmails.com`
* **Include**: Screenshots, steps to reproduce, and the browser you're using.

### 3. Feature Requests

Have a "wouldn't it be cool if..." idea?

* Post it in `#feature-requests` on Slack.
* Upvote ideas from other agencies.

## 🗺️ Roadmap Transparency: What's Shipping Next?

We push updates frequently. You can always see exactly what we're working on in our public roadmap.

* **[View the Executive Roadmap](/business/roadmap/executive-roadmap)**: High-level strategic view.
* **[View the Feature Roadmap](/business/feature-taxonomy-and-roadmap)**: Detailed feature-by-feature breakdown.

### Upcoming Priorities (Next 30 Days)

1. **Agency Client Workspaces**: Refining the multi-tenant dashboard for easier client management.
2. **Migration Tools**: Smoothing the import process from other platforms.
3. **Beta Onboarding Polish**: Making this very guide obsolete!

## 🤝 Our Promise to You

* **We will not lose your data.**
* **We will not ghost you.**
* **We will listen.**

If something sucks, tell us. If something is amazing, tell your friends (but maybe keep the secret weapon to yourself for a little longer 😉).

Let's build the future of cold email together.
