# Executive Alerts and Notifications Journey (BF-005, EE-002)

Document Level: Implementation-Technical (UX Contract)  
Primary Personas: CEO, CFO, COO, VP Operations, Executive Assistant  
Related Stories: BF-003, BF-004, BF-005, BF-006, RP-001, CO-001, EE-002  

## 1. Overview

This journey defines how executives consume high-signal alerts and notifications generated by the business intelligence, deliverability, and cost/risk systems.

Objectives:

- Provide timely, prioritized, actionable alerts without noise.
- Ensure alignment with the queue-backed alert foundation (BF-005) and event semantics.
- Respect all constraints on approximation, security, and non-real-time guarantees.

This is a UX contract for any UI implementation and downstream automated journeys.

## 2. Persona & Preconditions

- Personas:
  - C-suite executives (CEO, CFO, COO).
  - VP Operations / Head of Deliverability.
  - Executive Assistants (where granted delegated access).
- Preconditions:
  - Authenticated with executive RBAC (BF-004).
  - Alert/notification pipeline implemented (BF-005):
    - Events ingested from PostHog/business events, infra health, revenue/cost analytics.
    - Queue-backed processing; no hard dependency on WebSockets for MVP.
  - Executive API / Queue Events API surfaces available (BF-006, queue-events).

## 3. Step-by-step Flow

1. Executive logs in and:
   - Sees a concise indication of new/critical alerts (e.g. badge in header, summary on Executive Overview).
2. User navigates to the Alerts/Notifications center.
3. Alerts center displays:
   - Sorted list of alerts with:
     - Severity (e.g. Critical, High, Info).
     - Category (Revenue Risk, Deliverability, Cost Anomaly, System Health, Compliance).
     - Timestamp and concise description.
   - Clear visual emphasis on:
     - Critical, high-impact alerts relevant to executive roles.
4. User can:
   - Filter by:
     - Severity, category, affected tenant, time range.
   - Click into an alert:
     - View detailed context (e.g. impacted tenants, key metrics).
     - Navigate to related journeys:
       - Tenant Summary,
       - Revenue Protection,
       - Cost Optimization,
       - System Health.
5. User can acknowledge/mark-as-read:
   - For personal view hygiene.
   - Without implying the underlying issue is fully resolved (unless explicitly modeled).

## 4. Expected UX & Data Behavior

- Source alignment:
  - Every alert category maps to defined events/metrics:
    - Revenue impact events,
    - Deliverability/health events,
    - Cost anomalies,
    - Security/compliance signals.
- Presentation:
  - Human-readable summaries:
    - “High bounce rate for top-tier tenant X may risk $Y of MRR” (with “modeled / approximate” where applicable).
  - Clear link to the underlying explanation:
    - “Learn more” opens relevant dashboards or docs, not raw event streams.
- Prioritization:
  - Critical alerts surfaced prominently; info-level alerts de-emphasized.
  - No infinite scroll of low-value noise.
- Transport independence:
  - UX does not assume a specific real-time mechanism:
    - It must work with polling/queue-backed updates.
    - Future channels (email/SMS/mobile) can be layered without changing semantics.

## 5. Constraints & Guardrails

- Must:
  - Respect RBAC:
    - Only authorized roles see tenant-level or sensitive alerts.
  - Use only documented semantics from:
    - PostHog events spec,
    - Queue Events API,
    - Executive API.
  - Communicate:
    - When values are approximate or modeled.
- Must not:
  - Promise “sub-second real-time” if backend is queue/batch-based.
  - Leak cross-tenant or internal-only insights to unauthorized personas.
  - Overload executives with implementation-detail noise.
