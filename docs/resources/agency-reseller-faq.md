# Agency Reseller Program: Business FAQ

You run the agency. You own the client relationship. We just provide the infrastructure that makes you look like a deliverability wizard.

Here are the answers to the most common business questions from agency founders.

## 🎨 White-Labeling & Branding

### Can I white-label the dashboard?

**Yes, but it's a phased rollout.**

* **Currently (Beta)**: You can add your agency logo to client reports. The dashboard itself retains PenguinMails branding.
* **Planned (Q2 2027)**: Full "Client Portal" white-labeling is on our roadmap. This will allow you to give clients a login to a dashboard that looks 100% like *your* software (custom domain, your colors, your logo).

### Do my clients see "PenguinMails" anywhere?

**Not if you don't want them to.**
Most agencies use our "Invisible Infrastructure" model. You manage everything from your master dashboard. Your clients never log in; they just receive the reports you generate (which can be branded with your logo).

## 💰 Billing & Pricing Models

### How do I bill my clients?

You have complete freedom to price your services however you see fit. We bill *you* for the infrastructure; you bill *your client* for the value.

**Common Agency Models:**

1. **The "All-Inclusive" Retainer**: You charge \$2,000/mo for "Cold Email Lead Gen" and absorb the infrastructure cost (e.g., \$50/mo) as a business expense. *Recommended for high-margin agencies.*
2. **The "Infrastructure Fee"**: You charge a management fee plus a separate line item for "Tech Stack & Sending Infrastructure."
3. **The Markup**: You resell the infrastructure at a 2x-3x markup.

### Do you offer agency discounts?

**Yes.** We offer volume-based pricing tiers for agencies managing 10+ workspaces. Contact sales for our "Agency Partner" rate card.

## 🤝 Client Ownership

### Do you ever talk to my clients?

**Absolutely not.**
We are infrastructure providers. You are the partner. We will never contact your clients directly. All support tickets regarding a client's workspace must be submitted by *you* (the agency admin).

### What happens if a client leaves my agency?

You own the workspace and the data.

* **If you want to transfer them**: We have a "Workspace Transfer" feature (coming Q2 2026) that allows you to hand over ownership of a workspace (and its billing responsibility) to the client directly.
* **If you want to shut them down**: You can archive or delete their workspace instantly from your admin panel.

### Can I manage multiple clients from one login?

**Yes.** This is our core feature.
Our "Agency Client Workspaces" allow you to toggle between unlimited client accounts from a single master login. No logging in and out. No password spreadsheets.

## 🚀 Scaling

### Is there a limit to how many clients I can add?

No. Our infrastructure is built to scale. Whether you have 5 clients or 500, the dashboard performance remains the same.

### How fast can I spin up a new client?

**About 5 minutes.**
Once you have your master account, adding a new client workspace, provisioning a dedicated IP, and setting up the initial domains takes just a few clicks.
