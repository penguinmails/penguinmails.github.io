# GDPR Compliance Checklist for Cold Email

Sending cold emails to European prospects? You need to be GDPR compliant. The fines for non-compliance can reach up to **€20 million or 4% of global revenue** (whichever is higher).

Use this 20-point checklist to audit your campaigns and protect your business.

> **Disclaimer**: This is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Consult with a qualified attorney for specific legal guidance.

## ✅ The 20-Point Compliance Checklist

### 1. Legal Basis & Consent

- [ ] **Legitimate Interest Assessment (LIA)**: Have you documented *why* you have a legitimate interest in contacting this person? (e.g., B2B relevance).
- [ ] **Targeting Relevance**: Is the product/service directly relevant to the recipient's professional role?
- [ ] **No "Spray and Pray"**: Can you prove you didn't just buy a random list?
- [ ] **B2B Focus**: Are you strictly emailing business addresses (not personal @gmail.com accounts)?

### 2. Transparency & Rights

- [ ] **Identity Disclosure**: Is it clear who is sending the email? (No misleading "From" names).
- [ ] **Physical Address**: Does your email footer include a valid physical postal address?
- [ ] **Privacy Policy Link**: Is there a direct link to your privacy policy in the email footer?
- [ ] **Source of Data**: If asked, can you tell the recipient exactly where you got their data?

### 3. Opt-Out Mechanism

- [ ] **One-Click Unsubscribe**: Is there a clear, functioning unsubscribe link?
- [ ] **Immediate Processing**: Do you process unsubscribes within 30 days (ideally instantly)?
- [ ] **Suppression List**: Do you maintain a "Do Not Contact" list to prevent re-emailing unsubscribed users?
- [ ] **No "Log In to Unsubscribe"**: Is the process frictionless?

### 4. Data Management

- [ ] **Data Minimization**: Are you only storing data you actually need (Name, Email, Job Title)?
- [ ] **Data Accuracy**: Do you regularly clean your lists to remove invalid emails?
- [ ] **Data Retention Policy**: Do you delete data that is no longer needed?
- [ ] **Security**: Is your prospect data stored securely (encrypted, password protected)?

### 5. Vendor & Third-Party

- [ ] **Processor Agreements**: Do your email tools (like PenguinMails) have a Data Processing Agreement (DPA)?
- [ ] **International Transfers**: If data moves outside the EU, are Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) in place?
- [ ] **Vendor Audit**: Have you vetted your lead data providers for compliance?
- [ ] **Breach Notification**: Do you have a plan to notify authorities within 72 hours of a data breach?

## ⚠️ Penalty Risk Calculator

How much could a violation cost you? Use this manual worksheet to estimate your risk exposure.

### The Formula

**Risk Score** = (Volume of Emails × Sensitivity Factor) + (Revenue Tier × Visibility Factor)

### 1. Volume of Emails (Monthly)

* < 1,000 emails: **1 point**
- 1,000 - 10,000 emails: **3 points**
- 10,000+ emails: **5 points**

### 2. Sensitivity Factor

* Generic B2B (<info@company.com>): **1 point**
- Personalized B2B (<firstname.lastname@company.com>): **3 points**
- Personal (<name@gmail.com>): **10 points (High Risk)**

### 3. Revenue Tier

* < $1M Annual Revenue: **1 point**
- $1M - $10M Annual Revenue: **3 points**
- $10M+ Annual Revenue: **5 points**

### 4. Visibility Factor

* Unknown Brand: **1 point**
- Known Industry Brand: **3 points**
- Household Name: **5 points**

### Your Score

* **0-5 Points**: Low Risk (Standard compliance checks needed)
- **6-12 Points**: Medium Risk (Audit recommended immediately)
- **13+ Points**: High Risk (Legal consultation required)

> **Example**: A mid-sized agency ($5M revenue) sending 15,000 personalized emails per month.
> Score: (5 × 3) + (3 × 1) = **18 Points (High Risk)**

## 📚 Case Studies: Lessons from Fines

### 1. The "Bought List" Blunder

**Company**: Knöchelmann (Germany)
**Fine**: €9,000
**Violation**: Sending cold emails to individuals without valid consent or legitimate interest, using a purchased list.
**Lesson**: Buying a list does not give you the right to email it. You must conduct your own Legitimate Interest Assessment.

### 2. The "Unsubscribe" Failure

**Company**: Amex (UK)
**Fine**: £90,000
**Violation**: Sending 4 million "service emails" that contained marketing messages to customers who had opted out.
**Lesson**: You cannot disguise marketing as "service updates." Unsubscribe requests must be honored absolutely.
