## Quick Reference

### Queue Types

| Queue Type | Purpose | Priority | Use Case |
|------------|---------|----------|----------|
| `email:processing:high` | Critical email processing | ≤ 50 | Urgent email handling |
| `email:processing` | Standard email processing | 51-150 | Regular email workflows |
| `email:processing:low` | Background email tasks | > 150 | Batch operations |
| `analytics:daily-aggregate` | Daily data aggregation | 100 | Report generation |
| `warmup:process` | Email warmup tasks | 75 | Deliverability optimization |
| `bounce:process` | Bounce handling | 75 | Delivery failure management |

### Job States

- **queued**: Job created, waiting for processing

- **migrated_to_redis**: Job moved to Redis queue

- **running**: Currently being processed by worker

- **completed**: Successfully finished

- **failed**: Failed after max attempts

- **retry_scheduled**: Scheduled for retry
