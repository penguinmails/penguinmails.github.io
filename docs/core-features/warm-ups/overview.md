# Achieve 95%+ Inbox Placement with Automated Reputation Building

## The #1 Factor in Cold Email Success

**Most cold email campaigns fail not because of poor messaging, but because emails never reach the inbox.** Email providers like Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook use sophisticated algorithms to filter emails, and new accounts start with zero reputation. Our automated warm-up system transforms zero-reputation email addresses into trusted senders that achieve **95%+ inbox placement within 21 days**.

**The Business Impact**: Poor deliverability costs companies an average of **$420,000 annually** in lost revenue. Our warm-up system delivers **3-5x improvement in deliverability rates** and **50-70% increase in campaign response rates**.
