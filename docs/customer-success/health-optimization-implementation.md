## Health Optimization Framework

### Monthly Health Monitoring Workflow

## Week 1: Data Collection & Analysis

1. Extract monthly usage data from analytics platform
2. Calculate health scores using weighted component model
3. Identify health score changes >15 points from previous month
4. Flag accounts in At-Risk (<70) or Critical (<50) ranges
5. Generate monthly health report for CSM team review

## Week 2: Proactive Outreach Planning

1. Prioritize accounts by health score decline severity and revenue impact
2. Assign CSM ownership for at-risk account interventions
3. Schedule proactive outreach calls with declining accounts
4. Prepare account-specific talking points and intervention strategies
5. Coordinate cross-functional support needs (technical, product, finance)

## Week 3: Intervention Execution

1. Conduct scheduled health check calls with at-risk accounts
2. Document root causes of health decline in CRM system
3. Implement immediate interventions (technical fixes, training, support)
4. Establish success plans with clear metrics and timelines
5. Schedule follow-up touchpoints for progress monitoring

## Week 4: Results Tracking & Adjustment

1. Monitor intervention effectiveness through usage trend analysis
2. Adjust intervention strategies based on early results
3. Document successful approaches for playbook refinement
4. Escalate critical accounts requiring executive engagement
5. Prepare monthly health optimization summary for leadership

## Health Monitoring Procedures

### Daily Health Monitoring (Automated Alerts)

**Critical Alert Triggers**:

- Account inactive for 14+ consecutive days → Immediate CSM notification
- Health score drops below 50 → Escalate to CSM director within 24 hours
- Payment failure or billing dispute → Alert CSM and finance team
- Support ticket marked "urgent" or "critical" → CSM review within 4 hours

**Alert Response Protocol**:

1. **Immediate Acknowledgment** (Within 2 hours): CSM reviews alert and account context
2. **Initial Assessment** (Within 4 hours): Determine if immediate intervention needed
3. **Action Plan** (Within 24 hours): Document intervention strategy in CRM
4. **Execution** (Within 48 hours): Initiate customer contact and intervention
5. **Follow-up** (72 hours): Confirm issue resolution and monitor health recovery

### Weekly Health Review (Team Coordination)

**CSM Team Stand-up Agenda** (30 minutes):

1. Review new at-risk accounts identified in past week
2. Share intervention successes and challenges
3. Coordinate cross-functional support needs
4. Identify expansion opportunities from healthy accounts
5. Update health optimization playbook with new learnings

**Account Portfolio Health Dashboard**:

- Total accounts by health score range (Healthy/Stable/At-Risk)
- Week-over-week health score trend analysis
- Intervention success rate tracking
- Expansion opportunity pipeline status
- Churn risk forecast for upcoming quarter

## Customer Satisfaction Analysis

### NPS Survey Implementation

**Survey Cadence**:

- **Quarterly NPS Survey**: All active customers (>90 days tenure)
- **Post-Onboarding Survey**: Day 30 after initial activation
- **Post-Support Survey**: After critical support ticket resolution
- **Pre-Renewal Survey**: 60 days before contract renewal date

**Survey Response Analysis Workflow**:

1. **Promoters (9-10)**: Identify advocacy and expansion opportunities
2. **Passives (7-8)**: Engage for feedback and improvement opportunities
3. **Detractors (0-6)**: Immediate CSM outreach within 24 hours
4. **Non-Responders**: Follow-up outreach after 7 days

**Detractor Response Protocol**:

1. **Immediate Contact** (Within 24 hours): CSM reaches out to understand concerns
2. **Root Cause Analysis** (Within 48 hours): Document specific pain points and issues
3. **Action Plan** (Within 72 hours): Develop targeted resolution strategy
4. **Executive Escalation** (If needed): Engage leadership for high-value accounts
5. **Follow-up Survey** (30 days): Measure satisfaction improvement after intervention

## Churn Prevention Tracking

### At-Risk Account Management Process

**Identification Phase** (Ongoing):

**Assessment Phase** (Week 1):

1. Review complete account history and health score trends
2. Analyze usage patterns to identify specific decline triggers
3. Review support ticket history for unresolved pain points
4. Assess contract renewal timeline and revenue at risk
5. Determine intervention priority based on revenue impact and save probability

**Intervention Phase** (Weeks 2-4)**:

1. **Immediate Outreach**: Schedule call with key stakeholder within 48 hours
2. **Discovery Call**: Understand current challenges and changing needs
3. **Solution Development**: Create customized action plan addressing root causes
4. **Resource Allocation**: Assign technical support, training, or product resources
5. **Progress Monitoring**: Weekly check-ins to track improvement

**Resolution Phase** (Weeks 5-8)**:

1. Confirm health score recovery to stable range (>70)
2. Document successful intervention strategies for playbook
3. Establish ongoing engagement cadence to prevent future decline
4. Transition to standard account management with monthly monitoring
5. Share learnings with CSM team for continuous improvement
