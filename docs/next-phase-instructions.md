## Task Instructions for Next Chat Session

### Primary Objective
Transform the completed technical specifications into actionable user stories, prioritized milestones, and a structured product backlog that development teams can use for implementation.

### Required Analysis Areas

#### 1. User Stories Framework Analysis
**Research and recommend optimal approaches:**
- **User Story Templates:** Evaluate different user story formats (As a [role], I want [feature], So that [benefit])
- **Story Point Estimation:** Methods for sizing technical complexity (Fibonacci, T-shirt sizes, etc.)
- **Acceptance Criteria Templates:** Standard patterns for defining "done" criteria
- **Epic vs. Feature vs. Story Hierarchy:** How to structure business objectives → features → user stories

**Key Questions to Investigate:**
- What user story frameworks work best for executive/business intelligence systems?
- How to handle cross-functional technical implementations (database + frontend + backend)?
- Best practices for dependency management between user stories?

#### 2. Milestone Structure Analysis
**Research milestone approaches for complex technical implementations:**
- **Time-based vs. Feature-based Milestones:** Pros/cons for business intelligence systems
- **MVP Definition:** What's the minimum viable business intelligence offering?
- **Release Strategy:** How to break complex implementations into deployable increments
- **Dependency Mapping:** Critical path analysis for technical implementations

**Key Questions to Investigate:**
- How to structure milestones for database migrations + application development?
- What's the optimal milestone size for executive dashboard implementations?
- How to handle quality gates and validation requirements?

#### 3. Product Backlog Prioritization Methods
**Research prioritization frameworks:**
- **MoSCoW Method:** Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have
- **WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First):** Cost of delay vs. job size
- **RICE Scoring:** Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort
- **Value vs. Effort Matrix:** Visual prioritization approach

**Key Questions to Investigate:**
- Which prioritization method works best for executive/business intelligence features?
- How to balance technical debt reduction vs. new feature development?
- How to incorporate stakeholder feedback and executive requirements?

#### 4. Development Workflow Integration
**Analyze how user stories integrate with existing workflows:**
- **Jira/Linear Integration:** Story creation and tracking
- **GitHub Issues/Tickets:** Lightweight project management
- **Sprint Planning:** Two-week sprint structure recommendations
- **Definition of Done:** Technical and business completion criteria

**Key Questions to Investigate:**
- Best tools for managing business intelligence development projects?
- How to track both technical tasks and business outcomes?
- Integration with existing project management workflows?
