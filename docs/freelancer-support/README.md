## Task Completion Standards

### Definition of Done (DoD)

As a freelancer working on PenguinMails tasks, you must ensure every task meets these completion criteria:

#### General Task Completion

A task is **Done** when:

- ✅ All acceptance criteria are met
- ✅ Work is reviewed, tested, and approved by the lead
- ✅ Jira status is updated with all links or screenshots
- ✅ No blockers or pending dependencies remain
- ✅ Work is verified on staging

#### Development Tasks

- ✅ Code is committed, reviewed, and merged into the right branch
- ✅ Follows linting and naming standards
- ✅ Tested manually or with unit tests
- ✅ Documentation or .env.sample updated if needed
- ✅ Successfully deployed to staging

#### Bug Fixes

- ✅ Fix verified in staging with before/after proof
- ✅ Related areas regression-tested

#### Research Spikes

- ✅ Includes clear findings or recommendations

### Story Points Guide

Story points measure the relative effort to complete a task, considering complexity, uncertainty, and dependencies—not just time.

#### How We Estimate

We use relative estimation, comparing new tasks to known examples:

| Story Points | Meaning | Typical Effort |
| :----- | :----- | :---- |
| 1 point | Very small task | Quick config, text change, or minor UI fix, simple investigation or quick validation |
| 2 points | Small task | One function, small component, or bug fix |
| 3 points | Medium task | New feature with some logic or API use, Research + short proof of concept |
| 5 points | Large task | Multi-step logic, backend + frontend integration, deep research spike with multiple dependencies |
| 8 points | Complex feature | Multiple systems involved, requires testing + review |
| 13 points | Very complex | Requires research or touches critical flows (may split) |

**Important**: Always provide effort estimates (in story points) and delivery timeframes before accepting any task, as outlined in the [Operations Framework](/docs/operations/freelancer-management/framework.md).
