## Task Completion Standards

### Definition of Done (DoD)

As a freelancer working on PenguinMails tasks, you must ensure every task meets these completion criteria:

#### General Task Completion

- [x] All acceptance criteria are met

- [x] Work is reviewed, tested, and approved by the lead

- [x] Jira status is updated with all links or screenshots

- [x] No blockers or pending dependencies remain

- [x] Work is verified on staging

- [x] Follows linting and naming standards

- [x] Tested manually or with unit tests

- [x] Successfully deployed to staging

### Story Points Guide

Story points measure the relative effort to complete a task, considering complexity, uncertainty, and dependencies—not just time.

#### How We Estimate

We use relative estimation, comparing new tasks to known examples:

| Story Points | Meaning | Typical Effort |
| :----- | :----- | :---- |
| 1 point | Very small task | Quick config, text change, or minor UI fix, simple investigation or quick validation |
| 2 points | Small task | One function, small component, or bug fix |
| 3 points | Medium task | New feature with some logic or API use, Research + short proof of concept |
| 5 points | Large task | Multi-step logic, backend + frontend integration, deep research spike with multiple dependencies |
| 8 points | Complex feature | Multiple systems involved, requires testing + review |
| 13 points | Very complex | Requires research or touches critical flows (may split) |

**Important**: Always provide effort estimates (in story points) and delivery timeframes before accepting any task, as outlined in the [Operations Framework](/docs/operations/freelancer-management/framework).
